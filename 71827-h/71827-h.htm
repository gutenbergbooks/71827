<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>In the preparation of Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_II">II</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_III">III</a>, and <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI</a> of this book I
have drawn on a University of California syllabus, “Three Essays
on the Antiquity and Races of Man”; for Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_VII">VII</a>, on
an article “Heredity, Environment, and Civilization” in the
<i>American Museum Journal</i> for 1918; and Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_V">V</a> makes use
of some passages of “The Languages of the American Indians”
from the <i>Popular Science Monthly</i> of 1911. In each case there
has been revision and for the most part rewriting.</p>

<p>Whatever quality of lucidity the volume may have is due to
several thousand young men and women with whom I have
been associated during many years at the University of California.
Without their unwitting but real co-authorship the book
might never have been written, or would certainly have been
written less simply.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="section1">1. <span class="smcap">Anthropology, Biology, History</span></h3>

<p>Anthropology is the science of man. This broad and literal
definition takes on more meaning when it is expanded to “the
science of man and his works.” Even then it may seem
heterogeneous and too inclusive. The products of the human
mind are something different from the body. And these products,
as well as the human body, are the subjects of firmly
established sciences, which would seem to leave little room for
anthropology except as a less organized duplication. Ordinary
political history, economics, literary criticism, and the history
of art all deal with the works and doings of man; biology and
medicine study his body. It is evident that these various
branches of learning cannot be relegated to the position of mere
subdivisions of anthropology and this be exalted to the rank
of a sort of holding corporation for them. There must be some
definite and workable relation.</p>

<p>One way in which this relation can be pictured follows to
some extent the course of anthropology as it grew into self-consciousness
and recognition. Biology, medicine, history, economies
were all tilling their fields of knowledge in the nineteenth
century, some with long occupancy, when anthropology
shyly entered the scene and began to cultivate a corner here
and a patch there. It examined some of the most special and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
non-utilitarian aspects of the human body: the shape of the
head, the complexion, the texture of the hair, the differences
between one variety of man and another, points of negligible
import in medicine and of quite narrow interest as against the
broad principles which biology was trying to found and fortify
as the science of all life. So too the historical sciences had preëmpted
the most convenient and fruitful subjects within reach.
Anthropology modestly turned its attention to nations without
records, to histories without notable events, to institutions
strange in flavor and inventions hanging in their infancy, to
languages that had never been written.</p>

<p>Yet obviously the heterogeneous leavings of several sciences
will never weld into an organized and useful body of knowledge.
The dilettante, the collector of oddities who loves incoherence,
may be content to observe to-day the flare of the negro’s nostrils,
to-morrow the intricacy of prefixes that bind his words into
sentences, the day after, his attempts to destroy a foe by driving
nails into a wooden idol. A science becomes such only when it
learns to discover relations and a meaning in facts. If anthropology
were to remain content with an interest in the Mongolian
eye, the dwarfishness of the Negrito, the former home of the
Polynesian race, taboos against speaking to one’s mother-in-law,
rituals to make rain, and other such exotic and superseded superstitions,
it would earn no more dignity than an antiquarian’s
attic. As a co-laborer on the edifice of fuller understanding,
anthropology must find more of a task than filling with rubble
the temporarily vacant spaces in the masonry that the sciences
are rearing.</p>

<p>The other manner in which the subject of anthropology can
be conceived is that this is neither so vast as to include everything
human, nor is it the unappropriated odds and ends of other
sciences, but rather some particular aspect of human phenomena.
If such an aspect exists, anthropology vindicates its unity and
attains to integrity of aim.</p>

<h3 id="section2">2. <span class="smcap">Organic and Social Elements</span></h3>

<p>To the question why a Louisiana negro is black and thick
lipped, the answer is ready. He was born so. As dogs produce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
pups, and lions cubs, so negro springs from negro and Caucasian
from Caucasian. We call the force at work, heredity.
The same negro is lazy by repute, easy going at his labor. Is
this too an innate quality? Off-hand, most of us would reply:
Yes. He sings at his corn-hoeing more frequently than the white
man across the fence. Is this also because of his heredity? “Of
course: he is made so,” might be a common answer; “Probably:
why not?” a more cautious one. But now our negro is singing
Suwanee River, which his great-grandfather in Africa assuredly
did not sing. As regards the specific song, heredity is obviously
no longer the cause. Our negro may have learned it from an
uncle, perhaps from his schoolmates; he can have acquired it
from human beings not his ancestors, acquired it as part of his
customs, like being a member of the Baptist church and wearing
overalls, and the thousand other things that come to him from
without instead of from within. At these points heredity is displaced
by tradition, nature by nurture, to use a familiar jingle.
The efficient forces now are quite different from those that made
his skin black and his lips thick. They are causes of another
order.</p>

<p>The particular song of the negro and his complexion represent
the clear-cut extremes of the matter. Between them lie the
sloth and the inclination to melody. Obviously these traits may
also be the result of human example, of social environment, of
contemporary tradition. There are those that so believe, as well
as those who see in them only the effects of inborn biological
impulse. Perhaps these intermediate dubious traits are the results
of a blending of nature and nurture, the strength of each
factor varying according to each trait or individual examined.
Clearly, at any rate, there is room here for debate and evidence.
A genuine problem exists. This problem cannot be solved by
the historical sciences alone because they do not concern themselves
with heredity. Nor can it be solved by biology which
deals with heredity and allied factors but does not go on to
operate with the non-biological principle of tradition.</p>

<p>Here, then, is a specific task and place in the sun for anthropology:
the interpretation of those phenomena into which both
organic and social causes enter. The untangling and determination
and reconciling of these two sets of forces are anthropology’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
own. They constitute, whatever else it may undertake, the
focus of its attention and an ultimate goal. No other science
has grappled with this set of problems as its primary end. Nor
has anthropology as yet much of a solution to offer. It may be
said to have cleared the ground of brush, rather than begun
the felling of its tree. But, in the terminology of science, it
has at least defined its problem.</p>

<p>To deal with this interplay of what is natural and nurtural,
organic and social, anthropology must know something of the
organic, as such, and of the social, as such. It must be able to
recognize them with surety before it endeavors to analyze and
resynthesize them. It must therefore effect close contact with
the organic and the social sciences respectively, with “biology”
and “history,” and derive all possible aid from their contributions
to knowledge. Up to the present time, a large part of the
work of anthropology has consisted in acquiring the fruits of
the activity of these sister sciences and applying them for its
own ends; or, where the needed biological and historical data
were not available, securing them.</p>

<h3 id="section3">3. <span class="smcap">Physical Anthropology</span></h3>

<p>The organic sciences underlie the social ones. They are more
directly “natural.” Anthropology has therefore found valuable
general principles in biology: laws of heredity, the doctrines of
cell development and evolution, for instance, based on facts from
the whole range of life. Its business has been to ascertain how
far these principles apply to man, what forms they take in his
particular case. This has meant a concentration of attention,
the devising of special methods of inquiry. Many biological
problems, including most physiological and hereditary ones, can
be most profitably attacked in the laboratory, or at least under
experimental conditions. This method, however, is but rarely
open as regards human beings, who must ordinarily be observed
as they are. The phenomena concerning man have to be taken
as they come and laboriously sifted and re-sifted afterward,
instead of being artificially simplified in advance, as by the
experimental method. Then, too, since anthropology was operating
within the narrow limits of one species, it was driven to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
concern itself with minute traits, such as the zoölogist is rarely
troubled with: the proportions of the length and breadth of the
skull—the famous cephalic index—for instance; the number of
degrees the arm bones are twisted, and the like. Also, as these
data had to be used in the gross, unmodifiable by artificially
varied conditions, it has been necessary to secure them from
all possible varieties of men, different races, sexes, ages, and
their nearest brute analogues. The result is that biological or
physical anthropology—“Somatology” it is sometimes called in
Anglo-Saxon countries, and simply “anthropology” in continental
Europe—has in part constituted a sort of specialization
or sharpening of general biology, and has become absorbed to
a considerable degree in certain particular phenomena and
methods of studying them about which general biologists, physiologists,
palæontologists, and students of medicine are usually
but vaguely informed.</p>

<h3 id="section4">4. <span class="smcap">Cultural Anthropology</span></h3>

<p>The historical or social sciences overlie the organic ones.
Men’s bodies and natural equipment are back of their deeds and
accomplishments as transmitted by tradition, primary to their
culture or civilization. The relation of anthropology to historical
science has therefore been in a sense the opposite of its
relation to biological science. Instead of specializing, anthropology
has been occupied with trying to generalize the findings
of history. Historians cannot experiment. They deal with the
concrete, with the unique; for in a degree every historical event
has something unparalleled about it. They may paint with a
broad sweep, but they do not lay down exact laws.</p>

<p>Moreover, history inevitably begins with an interest in the
present and in ourselves. In proportion as it reaches back in
time and to wholly foreign peoples, its interest tends to flag and
its materials become scant and unreliable. It is commonly considered
useful for a man to know that Napoleon was a Corsican
and was defeated at Waterloo in 1815, but a rather pedantic
piece of knowledge that Shi Hwang-ti was born in northwestern
China and unified the rule of China in 221 B.C. From a theoretical
or general point of view, however, one of these facts is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
presumably as important as the other, for if we wish to know
the principles that go into the shaping of human social life or
civilization, China counts for as much as France, and the ancient
past for as much as the nearby present. In fact, the foreign and
the old are likely to be inquired into with even more assiduity
by the theoretically minded, since they may furnish wholly new
clues to insight, whereas the subjects of conventional history
have been so familiarized as to hold out less hope of novel conclusions
still to be extricated from them.</p>

<p>Here, then, is the cause of the seeming preoccupation of
social or cultural anthropology with ancient and savage and
exotic and extinct peoples: the desire to understand better all
civilizations, irrespective of time and place, in the abstract or
in form of generalized principle if possible. It is not that cave
men are more illuminating than Romans, or flint knives more
interesting than fine porcelains or the art of printing, that has
led anthropology to bear so heavily on the former, but the fact
that it wanted to know about cave men and flint knives as well
as about Romans and printing presses. It would be irrational
to prefer the former to the latter, and anthropology has never
accepted the adjudication sometimes tacitly rendered that its
proper field is the primitive, as such. As well might zoölogy
confine its interest to eggs or protozoans. It is probably true
that many researches into early and savage history have sprung
from an emotional predilection for the forgotten or neglected,
the obscure and strange, the unwonted and mysterious. But
such occasional personal æsthetic trends can not delimit the
range of a science or determine its aims and methods. Innumerable
historians have been inveterate gossips. One does
not therefore insist that the only proper subject of history is
backstairs intimacies.</p>

<p>This, then, is the reason for the special development of those
subdivisions of anthropology known as Archæology, “the science
of what is old” in the career of humanity, especially as revealed
by excavations of the sites of prehistoric occupation; and Ethnology,
“the science of peoples,” irrespective of their degree
of advancement.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h3 id="section5">5. <span class="smcap">Evolutionary Processes and Evolutionistic Fancies</span></h3>

<p>In their more elementary aspects the two strands of the
organic and the social, or the hereditary and environmental,
as they are generally called with reference to individuals, run
through all human life and are distinguishable as mechanisms,
as well as in their results. Thus a comparison of the acquisition
of the power of flight respectively by birds in their organic
development out of the ancestral reptile stem some millions of
years ago, and by men as a result of cultural progress in the
field of invention during the past generation, reveals at once
the profound differences of process that inhere in the ambiguous
concept of “evolution.” The bird gave up a pair of walking
limbs to acquire wings. He added a new faculty by transforming
part of an old one. The sum total of his parts or organs
was not greater than before. The change was transmitted only
to the blood descendants of the altered individuals. The reptile
line went on as it had been before, or if it altered, did so for
causes unconnected with the evolution of the birds. The
aeroplane, on the contrary, gave men a new faculty without impairing
any of those they had previously possessed. It led to no
visible bodily changes, nor alterations of mental capacity. The
invention has been transmitted to individuals and groups not
derived by descent from the inventors; in fact, has already
influenced their careers. Theoretically, it is transmissible to
ancestors if they happen to be still living. In sum, it represents
an accretion to the stock of existing culture rather than a transformation.</p>

<p>Once the broad implications of the distinction which this
example illustrates have been grasped, many common errors
are guarded against. The program of eugenics, for instance,
loses much of its force. There is certainly much to be said in
favor of intelligence and discrimination in mating, as in everything
else. There is need for the acquisition of exacter knowledge
on human heredity. But, in the main, the claims sometimes
made that eugenics is necessary to preserve civilization
from dissolution, or to maintain the flourishing of this or that
nationality, rest on the fallacy of recognizing only organic causes
as operative, when social as well as organic ones are active—when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
indeed the social factors may be much the more powerful
ones. So, in what are miscalled race problems, the average
thought of the day still reasons largely from social effects to
organic causes and perhaps vice versa. Anthropology is by no
means yet in a position to state just where the boundary between
the contributing organic and social causes of such phenomena
lies. But it does hold to their fundamental distinctness and to
the importance of this distinctness, if true understanding is
the aim. Without sure grasp of this principle, many of the
arguments and conclusions in the present volume will lose their
significance.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the designation of anthropology as “the child
of Darwin” is most misleading. Darwin’s essential achievement
was that he imagined, and substantiated by much indirect evidence,
a mechanism through which organic evolution appeared
to be taking place. The whole history of man however being
much more than an organic matter, a pure Darwinian anthropology
would be largely misapplied biology. One might almost
as justly speak of a Copernican or Newtonian anthropology.</p>

<p>What has greatly influenced anthropology, mainly to its
damage, has been not Darwinism, but the vague idea of evolution,
to the organic aspect of which Darwin gave such substance
that the whole group of evolutionistic ideas has luxuriated
rankly ever since. It became common practice in social anthropology
to “explain” any part of human civilization by arranging
its several forms in an evolutionary sequence from lowest
to highest and allowing each successive stage to flow spontaneously
from the preceding—in other words, without specific cause.
At bottom this logical procedure was astonishingly naïve. We
of our land and day stood at the summit of the ascent, in these
schemes. Whatever seemed most different from our customs
was therefore reckoned as earliest, and other phenomena disposed
wherever they would best contribute to the straight evenness
of the climb upward. The relative occurrence of phenomena
in time and space was disregarded in favor of their
logical fitting into a plan. It was argued that since we hold
to definitely monogamous marriage, the beginnings of human
sexual union probably lay in indiscriminate promiscuity. Since
we accord precedence to descent from the father, and generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
know him, early society must have reckoned descent from the
mother and no one knew his father. We abhor incest; therefore
the most primitive men normally married their sisters. These
are fair samples of the conclusions or assumptions of the classic
evolutionistic school of anthropology, whose roster was graced
by some of the most illustrious names in the science. Needless
to say, these men tempered the basic crudity of their opinions
by wide knowledge, acuity or charm of presentation, and frequent
insight and sound sense in concrete particulars. In their
day, a generation or two ago, under the spell of the concept
of evolution in its first flush, such methods of reasoning were
almost inevitable. To-day they are long threadbare, descended
to material for newspaper science or idle speculation, and evidence
of a tendency toward the easy smugness of feeling oneself
superior to all the past. These ways of thought are mentioned
here only as an example of the beclouding that results
from baldly transferring biologically legitimate concepts into the
realm of history, or viewing this as unfolding according to a
simple plan of progress.</p>

<h3 id="section6">6. <span class="smcap">Age of Anthropological Science</span></h3>

<p>The foregoing exposition will make clear why anthropology is
generally regarded as one of the newer sciences—why its chairs
are few, its places in curricula of education scattered. As an
organized science, with a program and a method of its own, it
is necessarily recent because it could not arise until the biological
and social sciences had both attained enough organized development
to come into serious contact.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as an unmethodical body of knowledge,
as an interest, anthropology is plainly one of the oldest of the
sisterhood of sciences. How could it well be otherwise than
that men were at least as much interested in each other as in
the stars and mountains and plants and animals? Every savage
is a bit of an ethnologist about neighboring tribes and knows a
legend of the origin of mankind. Herodotus, the “father of
history,” devoted half of his nine books to pure ethnology, and
Lucretius, a few centuries later, tried to solve by philosophical
deduction and poetical imagination many of the same problems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
that modern anthropology is more cautiously attacking with the
methods of science. In neither chemistry nor geology nor biology
was so serious an interest developed as in anthropology, until
nearly two thousand years after these ancients.</p>

<p>In the pages that follow, the central anthropological problems
that concern the relations of the organic and cultural factors in
man will be defined and solutions offered to the degree that they
seem to have been validly determined. On each side of this
goal, however, stretches an array of more or less authenticated
formulations, of which some of the more important will be reviewed.
On the side of the organic, consideration will tend
largely to matters of fact; in the sphere of culture, processes can
here and there be illustrated; in accord with the fact that
anthropology rests upon biological and underlies purely historical
science.</p>

<h3 id="section7">7. <span class="smcap">The “Missing Link”</span></h3>

<p>No modern zoölogist has the least doubt as to the general fact
of organic evolution. Consequently anthropologists take as their
starting point the belief in the derivation of man from some
other animal form. There is also no question as to where in a
general way man’s ancestry is to be sought. He is a mammal
closely allied to the other mammals, and therefore has sprung
from some mammalian type. His origin can be specified even
more accurately. The mammals fall into a number of fairly
distinct groups, such as the Carnivores or flesh-eating animals,
the Ungulates or hoofed animals, the Rodents or gnawing animals,
the Cetaceans or whales, and several others. The highest
of these mammalian groups, as usually reckoned, is the Primate
or “first” order of the animal kingdom. This Primate group
includes the various monkeys and apes and man. The ancestors
of the human race are therefore to be sought somewhere in the
order of Primates, past or present.</p>

<p>The popular but inaccurate expression of this scientific conviction
is that “man is descended from the monkeys,” but that
a link has been lost in the chain of descent: the famous “missing
link.” In a loose way this statement reflects modern scientific
opinion; but it certainly is partly erroneous. Probably not a
single authority maintains to-day that man is descended from
any species of monkey now living. What students during the
past sixty years have more and more come to be convinced of,
was already foreshadowed by Darwin: namely that man and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
apes are both descended from a common ancestor. This common
ancestor may be described as a primitive Primate, who differed
in a good many details both from the monkeys and from man,
and who has probably long since become extinct.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure01" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure01.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> Erroneous (left) and more valid (right) representation of
the descent of man.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The situation may be clarified by two diagrams (<a href="#figure01">Fig. 1</a>). The
first diagram represents the inaccurate view which puts the
monkey at the bottom of the line of descent, man at the top, and
the missing link in the middle of the straight line. The illogicality
of believing that our origin occurred in this manner is
apparent as soon as one reflects that according to this scheme
the monkey at the beginning and man at the end of the line
still survive, whereas the “missing link,” which is supposed to
have connected them, has become extinct.</p>

<p>Clearly the relation must be different. Whatever the missing
link may have been, the mere fact that he is not now alive on
earth means that we must construct our diagram so that it will
indicate his past existence as compared with the survival of man
and the apes. This means that the missing link must be put
lower in the figure than man and the apes, and our illustration
therefore takes on the form shown in the right half of <a href="#figure01">figure 1</a>,
which may be described as Y-shaped. The stem of the Y denotes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
the pre-ancestral forms leading back into other mammalian
groups and through them—if carried far enough down—to the
amphibians and invertebrates. The missing link comes at the
fork of the Y. He represents the last point at which man and
the monkeys were still one, and beyond which they separated
and became different. It is just because the missing link represented
the last common form that he was the link between man
and the monkeys. From him onwards, the monkeys followed
their own course, as indicated by the left-hand branch of the
Y, and man went his separate way along the right-hand branch.</p>

<h3 id="section8">8. <span class="smcap">Family Tree of the Primates</span></h3>

<p>While this second diagram illustrates the most essential elements
in modern belief as to man’s origin, it does not of course
pretend to give the details. To make the diagram at all precise,
the left fork of the Y, which here stands for the monkeys as a
group—in other words, represents all the living Primates other
than man—would have to be denoted by a number of branching
and subdividing lines. Each of the main branches would represent
one of the four or five subdivisions or “families” of the
Primates, such as the Anthropoid or manlike apes, and the
Cebidæ or South American monkeys. The finer branches would
stand for the several genera and species in each of these families.
For instance, the Anthropoid line would split into four, standing
respectively for the Gibbon, Orang-utan, Chimpanzee, and
Gorilla.</p>

<p>The fork of the Y representing man would not branch and
rebranch so intricately as the fork representing the monkeys.
Many zoölogists regard all the living varieties of man as constituting
a single species, while even those who are inclined to
recognize several species limit the number of these species to
three or four. Then too the known extinct varieties of man are
comparatively few. There is some doubt whether these human
fossil types are to be reckoned as direct ancestors of modern
man, and therefore as mere points in the main human line of
our diagram; or whether they are to be considered as having
been ancient collateral relatives who split off from the main line
of human development. In the latter event, their designation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
in the diagram would have to be by shorter lines branching out
of the human fork of the Y.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp75" id="figure02" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure02.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span> The descent of man, elaborated over <a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>. For further
ramifications, see Figures <a href="#figure03">3</a>, <a href="#figure04">4</a>, <a href="#figure09">9</a>.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This subject quickly becomes a technical problem requiring
rather refined evidence to answer. In general, prevailing opinion
looks upon the later fossil ancestors of man as probably direct
or true ancestors, but tends to regard the earlier of these extinct
forms as more likely to have been collateral ones. This verdict
applies with particular force to the earliest of all, the very one
which comes nearest to fulfilling the popular idea of the missing
link: the so-called <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>. If the Pithecanthropus
were truly the missing link, he would have to be put
at the exact crotch of the Y. Since he is recognized, however,
as a form more or less ancestral to man, and somewhat less
ancestral to the apes, he should probably be placed a short distance
up on the human stem of the Y, or close alongside it. On
the other hand, inasmuch as most palæontologists and comparative
anatomists believe that Pithecanthropus was not directly
ancestral to us, in the sense that no living men have Pithecanthropus
blood flowing in their veins, he would therefore be an
ancient collateral relative of humanity—a sort of great-great-granduncle—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
would be best represented by a short stub
coming out of the human line a little above its beginning
(<a href="#figure02">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

<p>Even this figure is not complete, since it is possible that some
of the fossil types which succeeded Pithecanthropus in point of
time, such as the Heidelberg and Piltdown men, were also collateral
rather than direct ancestors. Some place even the later
Neandertal man in the collateral class. It is only when the last
of the fossil types, the Cro-Magnon race, is reached, that opinion
becomes comparatively unanimous that this is a form directly
ancestral to us. For accuracy, therefore, <a href="#figure02">figure 2</a> might be revised
by the addition of other short lines to represent the several
earlier fossil types: these would successively spring from the
main human line at higher and higher levels.</p>

<p>In order not to complicate unnecessarily the fundamental
facts of the case—especially since many data are still interpreted
somewhat variously—no attempt will be made here to construct
such a complete diagram as authoritative. Instead, there are
added reproductions of the family tree of man and the apes
as the lineages have been worked out independently by two
authorities (Figs. <a href="#figure03">3</a>, <a href="#figure04">4</a>). It is clear that these two family trees
are in substantial accord as regards their main conclusions,
but that they show some variability in details. This condition
reflects the present state of knowledge. All experts are in accord
as to certain basic principles; but it is impossible to find two
authors who agree exactly in their understanding of the less
important data.</p>

<h3 id="section9">9. <span class="smcap">Geological and Glacial Time</span></h3>

<p>A remark should be made here as to the age of these ancestral
forms. The record of life on earth, as known from the fossils
in stratified rocks, is divided into four great periods. The
earliest, the <i>Primary</i> or <i>Palæozoic</i>, comprises about two-thirds
of the total lapse of geologic time. During the Palæozoic all
the principal divisions of invertebrate animals came into existence,
but of the vertebrates only the fishes. In the <i>Secondary</i>
or <i>Mesozoic</i> period, evolution progressed to the point where
reptiles were the highest and dominant type, and the first feeble
bird and mammal forms appeared. The Mesozoic embraces most
of the remaining third or so of the duration of life on the earth,
leaving only something like five million years for the last two
periods combined, as against thirty, fifty, ninety, or four hundred
million years that the Palæozoic and Mesozoic are variously
estimated to have lasted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>These last five million years or so of the earth’s history are
divided unequally between the <i>Tertiary</i> or Age of Mammals, and
the <i>Quaternary</i> or Age of Man. About four million years are
usually assigned to the Tertiary with its subdivisions, the
Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene, and Pliocene. The Quaternary was
formerly reckoned by geologists to have lasted only about a hundred
thousand years. Later this estimate was raised to four or
five hundred thousand, and at present the prevailing opinion
tends to put it at about a million years. There are to be recognized,
then, a four million year Age of Mammals before man,
or even any definitely pre-human form, had appeared; and a
final period of about a million years during which man gradually
assumed his present bodily and mental type. In this Quaternary
period fall all the forms which are treated in the following
pages.</p>

<p>The Quaternary is usually subdivided into two periods, the
Pleistocene and the Recent. The Recent is very short, perhaps
not more than ten thousand years. It represents, geologically
speaking, the mere instant which has elapsed since the final disappearance
of the great glaciers. It is but little longer than
historic time; and throughout the Recent there are encountered
only modern forms of man. Back of it, the much longer
Pleistocene is often described as the Ice Age or Glacial Epoch;
and both in Europe and North America careful research has
succeeded in demonstrating four successive periods of increase
of the ice. In Europe these are generally known as the Günz,
Mindel, Riss, and Würm glaciations. The probable American
equivalents are the Nebraskan, Kansan, Illinoian, and Wisconsin
periods of ice spread. Between each of these four came a warmer
period when the ice melted and its sheets receded. These are
the “interglacial periods” and are designated as the first,
second, and third. These glacial and interglacial periods are of
importance because they offer a natural chronology or time scale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
for the Pleistocene, and usually provide the best means of dating
the fossil human types that have been or may hereafter be
discovered (<a href="#figure05">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<h3 id="section10">10. <span class="smcap">Place of Man’s Origin and Development</span></h3>

<p>Before we proceed to the fossil finds themselves, we must note
that the greater part of the surface of the earth has been very
imperfectly explored. Africa, Asia, and Australia may quite
conceivably contain untold scientific treasures which have not
yet been excavated. One cannot assert that they are lying in
the soil or rocks of these continents; but one also cannot affirm
that they are not there. North and South America have been
somewhat more carefully examined, at least in certain of their
areas, but with such regularly negative results that the prevailing
opinion now is that these two continents—possibly
through being shut off by oceans or ice masses from the eastern
hemisphere—were not inhabited by man during the Pleistocene.
The origin of the human species cannot then be sought in the
western hemisphere. This substantially leaves Europe as the
one continent in which excavations have been carried on with
prospects of success; and it is in the more thoroughly explored
western half of Europe that all but two of the unquestioned
discoveries of ancient man have been made. One of these exceptional
finds is from Africa. The other happens to be the one
that dates earliest of all—the same Pithecanthropus already
mentioned as being the closest known approach to the “missing
link.” Pithecanthropus was found in Java.</p>

<p>Now it might conceivably prove true that man originated in
Europe and that this is the reason that the discoveries of his
most ancient remains have to date been so largely confined to
that continent. On the other hand, it does seem much more
reasonable to believe that this smallest of the continents, with
its temperate or cold climate, and its poverty of ancient and
modern species of monkeys, is likely not to have been the true
home, or at any rate not the only home, of the human family.
The safest statement of the case would be that it is not known
in what part of the earth man originated; that next to nothing
is known of the history of his development on most of the continents;
and that that portion of his history which chiefly is
known is the fragment which happened to take place in Europe.</p>

<h3 id="section11">11. <span class="smcap">Pithecanthropus</span></h3>

<p><i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>, the “erect ape-man,” was determined
from the top part of a skull, a thigh bone, and two molar teeth
found in 1891 under fifty feet of strata by Dubois, a Dutch
surgeon, near Trinil, in the East Indian island of Java. The
skull and the thigh lay some distance apart but at the same
level and probably are from the same individual. The period
of the stratum is generally considered early Pleistocene, possibly
approximately contemporary with the first or Günz glaciation
of Europe—nearly a million years ago, by the time scale
here followed. Java was then a part of the mainland of Asia.</p>

<p>The skull is low, with narrow receding forehead and heavy
ridges of bone above the eye sockets—“supraorbital ridges.”
The capacity is estimated at 850 or 900 cubic centimeters—half
as much again as that of a large gorilla, but nearly one-half less
than the average for modern man. The skull is dolichocephalic—long
for its breadth—like the skulls of all early fossil men;
whereas the anthropoid apes are more broad-headed. The jaws
are believed to have projected almost like a snout; but as they
remain undiscovered, this part of the reconstruction is conjectural.
The thigh bone is remarkably straight, indicating
habitual upright posture; its length suggests that the total body
stature was about 5 feet 7 inches, or as much as the height of
most Europeans.</p>

<p>Pithecanthropus was a terrestrial and not an arboreal form.
He seems to have been slightly more similar to modern man than
to any ape, and is the most primitive manlike type yet discovered.
But he is very different from both man and the apes, as
his name indicates: <i>Pithecanthropus</i> is a distinct genus, not
included in <i>Homo</i>, or man.</p>

<h3 id="section12">12. <span class="smcap">Heidelberg Man</span></h3>

<p>Knowledge of Heidelberg man rests on a single piece of bone—a
lower jaw found in 1907 by Schoetensack at a depth of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
nearly eighty feet in the Mauer sands not far from Heidelberg,
Germany. Like the Pithecanthropus remains, the Heidelberg
specimen lay in association with fossils of extinct mammals, a
fact which makes possible its dating. It probably belongs to
the second interglacial period, so that its antiquity is only about
half as great as that of Pithecanthropus (<a href="#figure05">Fig. 5</a>).</p>

<p>The jaw is larger and heavier than any modern human jaw.
The ramus, or upright part toward the socket, is enormously
broad, as in the anthropoid apes. The chin is completely lacking;
but this area does not recede so much as in the apes.
Heidelberg man’s mouth region must have projected considerably
more than that of modern man, but much less than that
of a gorilla or a chimpanzee. The contour of the jaw as seen
from above is human (oval), not simian (narrow and oblong).</p>

<p>The teeth, although large, are essentially human. They are
set close together, with their tops flush, as in man; the canines
lack the tusk-like character which they retain in the apes.</p>

<p>Since the skull and the limb bones of this form are wholly
unknown, it is somewhat difficult to picture the type as it appeared
in life. But the jaw being as manlike as it is apelike,
and the teeth distinctly human, the Heidelberg type is to be
regarded as very much nearer to modern man than to the ape,
or as farther along the line of evolutionary development than
Pithecanthropus; as might be expected from its greater recency.
This relationship is expressed by the name, <i>Homo Heidelbergensis</i>,
which recognizes the type as belonging to the genus man.</p>

<h3 id="section13">13. <span class="smcap">The Piltdown Form</span></h3>

<p>This form is reconstructed from several fragments of a female
brain case, some small portions of the face, nearly half the
lower jaw, and a number of teeth, found in 1911-13 by Dawson
and Woodward in a gravel layer at Piltdown in Sussex, England.
Great importance has been ascribed to this skull, but too
many of its features remain uncertain to render it safe to build
large conclusions upon the discovery. The age cannot be fixed
with positiveness; the deposit is only a few feet below the surface,
and in the open; the associated fossils have been washed
or rolled into the layer; some of them are certainly much older<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
than the skull, belonging to animals characteristic of the Pliocene,
that is, the Tertiary. If the age of the skull was the
third interglacial period, as on the whole seems most likely,
its antiquity might be less than a fourth that of Pithecanthropus
and half that of Heidelberg man.</p>

<p>The skull capacity has been variously estimated at 1,170,
nearly 1,300, and nearly 1,500 c.c.; the pieces do not join, so
that no certain proof can be given for any figure. Except for
unusual thickness of the bone, the skull is not particularly
primitive. The jaw and the teeth, on the other hand, are
scarcely distinguishable from those of a chimpanzee. They are
certainly far less human than the Heidelberg jaw and teeth,
which are presumably earlier. This human skull and simian
jaw are an almost incompatible combination. More than one
expert has got over the difficulty by assuming that the skull of
a contemporary human being and the jaw of a chimpanzee happened
to be deposited in the same gravel.</p>

<p>In view of these doubts and discrepancies, the claim that the
Piltdown form belongs to a genus <i>Eoanthropus</i> distinct from
that of man is to be viewed with reserve. This interpretation
would make the Piltdown type more primitive than the probably
antecedent Heidelberg man. Some authorities do regard it as
both more primitive and earlier.</p>

<h3 id="section14">14. <span class="smcap">Neandertal Man</span></h3>

<p>The preceding forms are each known only from partial fragments
of the bones of a single individual. The Neandertal race
is substantiated by some dozens of different finds, including half
a dozen nearly complete skulls, and several skeletons of which
the greater portions have been preserved. These fossils come
from Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, and what was Austro-Hungary,
or, roughly, from the whole western half of Europe.
They are all of similar type and from the Mousterian period
of the Palæolithic or Old Stone Age (§ <a href="#section70">70-72</a>, <a href="#figure17">Fig. 17</a>); whereas
Pithecanthropus, Heidelberg, and perhaps Piltdown are earlier
than the Stone Age. The Mousterian period may be dated as
coincident with the peak of the last or Würm glaciation, that is,
about 50,000 to 25,000 years ago. Its race—the Neandertal type—was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
clearly though primitively human; which fact is reflected
in the various systematic names that have been given it: <i>Homo
Neandertalensis</i>, <i>Homo Mousteriensis</i>, or <i>Homo primigenius</i>.</p>

<p>Neandertal man was short: around 5 feet 3 inches for men,
4 feet 10 inches for women, or about the same as the modern
Japanese. A definite curvature of his thigh bone indicates a
knee habitually somewhat bent, and probably a slightly stooping
or slouching attitude. All his bones are thickset: his musculature
must have been powerful. The chest was large, the
neck bull-like, the head hung forward upon it. This head was
massive: its capacity averaged around 1,550 c.c., or equal to
that of European whites and greater than the mean of all living
races of mankind (<a href="#figure06">Fig. 6</a>). The head was rather low and the
forehead sloped back. The supraorbital ridges were heavy: the
eyes peered out from under beetling brows. The jaws were
prognathous, though not more than in many Australians and
Negroes; the chin receded but existed.</p>

<p>The artifacts found in Mousterian deposits show that Neandertal
man chipped flint tools in several ways, knew fire, and
buried his dead. It may be assumed as almost certain that he
spoke some sort of language.</p>

<h3 id="section15">15. <span class="smcap">Rhodesian Man</span></h3>

<p>Quite recent is the discovery of an African fossil man. This
occurred in 1921 at Broken Hill Bone Cave in northern Rhodesia.
A nearly complete skull was found, though without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
lower jaw; a small piece of the upper jaw of a second individual;
and several other bones, including a tibia. The remains
were ninety feet deep in a cave, associated with vast quantities
of mineralized animal bones. Their age however is unknown.
The associated fauna is one of living species only; but this does
not imply the same recency as in Europe, since the animal life
of Africa has altered relatively little since well back in the
Pleistocene.</p>

<p>Measurements of Rhodesian man have not yet been published.
The available descriptions point to a small brain case with low
vault in the frontal region; more extremely developed eyebrow
ridges than in any living or fossil race of man, including
Pithecanthropus; a large gorilla-like face, with marked prognathism
and a long stretch between nose and teeth—the area
covered by the upper lip; a flaring but probably fairly prominent
nose; an enormous palate and dental arch—too large to
accommodate even the massive Heidelberg jaw; large teeth, but
without the projecting canines of the apes and of the lower
jaw attributed to Piltdown man; and a forward position of the
foramen magnum—the aperture by which the spinal cord enters
the brain—which suggests a fully upright position. The same
inference is derivable from the long, straight shin-bone.</p>

<p>On the whole, this seems to be a form most closely allied to
Neandertal man, though differing from him in numerous respects,
and especially in the more primitive type of face. It is
well to remember, however, that of none of the forms anterior
to Neandertal man—Pithecanthropus, Heidelberg, Piltdown—has
the face been recovered. If these were known, the Rhodesian
face might seem less impressively ape-like. It is also important
to observe that relatively primitive and advanced features exist
side by side in Rhodesian man; the face and eyebrow ridges
are somewhat off-set by the prominent nose, erect posture, and
long clean limb bones. It is therefore likely that this form was
a collateral relative of Neandertal man rather than his ancestor
or descendant. Its place in the history of the human species
can probably be fixed only after the age of the bones is determined.
Yet it is already clear that the discovery is important
in at least three respects. It reveals the most ape-like face yet
found in a human variety; it extends the record of fossil man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
to a new continent; and that continent is the home of the two
living apes—the gorilla and chimpanzee—recognized as most
similar to man.</p>

<h3 id="section16">16. <span class="smcap">The Cro-Magnon Race</span></h3>

<p>The Cro-Magnon race is not only within the human species,
but possibly among the ancestors of modern Europeans. While
Neandertal man is still <i>Homo Neandertalensis</i>—the genus of
living man, but a different species—the Cro-Magnon type is
<i>Homo sapiens</i>—that is, a variety of ourselves. The age is that
of the gradual, fluctuating retreat of the glaciers—the later
Cave period of the Old Stone Age: the Upper Palæolithic, in
technical language, comprising the Aurignacian, the Solutrean,
and the Magdalenian (§ <a href="#section70">70</a>). In years, this was the time from
25,000 to 10,000 B.C.</p>

<p>The Cro-Magnon race of Aurignacian times, as represented
by the finds at Cro-Magnon and Grimaldi,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> was excessively tall
and large-brained, surpassing any living race of man in both
respects.</p>

<p>The adult male buried at Cro-Magnon measured 5 feet 11
inches in life; five men at Grimaldi measured from 5 feet 10½
inches to 6 feet 4½ inches, averaging 6 feet 1½ inches. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
tallest men now on earth, certain Scots and Negroes, average less
than 5 feet 11 inches. A girl at Grimaldi measured 5 feet
5 inches. This race was not only tall, but clean-limbed, lithe,
and swift.</p>

<p>Their brains were equally large. Those of the five male skulls
from Grimaldi contain from over 1,700 to nearly 1,900 c.c.—an
average of 1,800 c.c.; that of the old man of Cro-Magnon,
nearly 1,600 c.c.; of a woman there, 1,550 c.c. If these individuals
were not exceptional, the figures mean that the size and
weight of the brain of the early Cro-Magnon people was some
fifteen or twenty per cent greater than that of modern Europeans.</p>

<p>The cephalic index is low—that is, the skull was long and
narrow, as in all the types here considered; but the face was
particularly broad. The forehead rose well domed; the supraorbital
development was moderate, as in recent men; the features
must have been attractive even by our standards.</p>

<p>Three of the best preserved skeletons of the Magdalenian
period are those of women. Their statures run 4 feet 7 inches,
5 feet 1 inch, 5 feet 1 inch, which would indicate a corresponding
normal height for men not far from that of the average
European of to-day. The male from Obercassel attained a stature
of about 5 feet 3 inches, a cranial capacity of 1,500 c.c., and
combined a long skull with a wide face. The general type of
the Magdalenian period might be described as a reduced Cro-Magnon
one.</p>

<p>The Cro-Magnon peoples used skilfully made harpoons, originated
a remarkable art, and in general attained a development
of industries parallel to their high degree of bodily progress.</p>

<h3 id="section17">17. <span class="smcap">The Brünn Race</span></h3>

<p>Several remains have been found in central Europe which have
sometimes been considered as belonging to the Neandertal race
and sometimes to the subsequent Cro-Magnon race, but do not
belong clearly with either, and may perhaps be regarded as distinct
from both and possibly bridging them. The type is generally
known as the Brünn race. Its habitat was Czecho-Slovakia
and perhaps adjacent districts; its epoch, postglacial,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
in the Solutrean period of the Upper Palæolithic (§ <a href="#section70">70</a>). The
Brünn race, so far as present knowledge of it goes, was therefore
both preceded and succeeded by Cro-Magnon man.</p>

<p>The Brünn race belongs with modern man: its species is no
longer <i>Homo Neandertalensis</i>, but <i>Homo sapiens</i>, to which we
also belong. The heavy supraorbital ridges of the earlier type
are now divided by a depression over the nose instead of stretching
continuously across the forehead; the chin is becoming pronounced,
the jaws protrude less than in Neandertal man. The
skull is somewhat higher and better vaulted. In all these respects
there is an approach to the Cro-Magnon race. But the
distinctively broad face of the Cro-Magnon people is not in
evidence.</p>

<p>A skull of uncertain geologic age, found in 1888 at Galley
Hill, near London, is by some linked with the Brünn race. The
same is true of an unusually well preserved skeleton found in
1909 at Combe-Capelle, in Périgord, southern France. The
period of the Combe-Capelle skeleton is Upper Palæolithic
Aurignacian. This was part of the era of the Cro-Magnon race
in western Europe; and as the Combe-Capelle remains do not
differ much from the Cro-Magnon type, they are best considered
as belonging to it.</p>

<h3 id="section18">18. <span class="smcap">The Grimaldi Race: Neolithic Races</span></h3>

<p>The Grimaldi race is to date represented by only two skeletons,
those of a woman and a youth—possibly mother and son—found
in 1906 in a grotto at Grimaldi near Mentone, in Italy,
close to the French border. They reposed in lower layers, above
which subsequent Cro-Magnon burials of Aurignacian date had
been made. Their age is therefore early Aurignacian: the beginning
of the Upper Palæolithic or later Cave period of the
Old Stone Age. The statures are 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet
1 inch—the youth was not fully grown; the skull capacities
1,375 and nearly 1,600 c.c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>The outstanding feature of both skeletons is that they bear
a number of Negroid characteristics. The forearm and lower
leg are long as compared with the upper arm and thigh; the
pelvis high and small; the jaws prognathous, the nose flat, the
eye orbits narrow. All these are Negro traits. This is important,
in view of the fact that all the other ancient fossils of men
are either more primitive than the living races or, like Cro-Magnon,
perhaps ancestral to the Caucasian race.</p>

<p>No fossil remains of any ancestral Mongolian type have yet
been discovered.</p>

<p>The New Stone Age, beginning about 10,000 or 8,000 B.C.,
brings the Grenelle and other types of man; but these are so
essentially modern that they need not be considered here. In
the Neolithic period, broad heads are for the first time encountered,
as they occur at present in Europe and other continents,
alongside of narrow ones. The virtual fixity of the human type
for these last ten thousand years is by no means incredible.
Egyptian mummies and skeletons prove that the type of that
country has changed little in five thousand years except as the
result of invasions and admixture.</p>

<h3 id="section19">19. <span class="smcap">The Metric Expression of Human Evolution</span></h3>

<p>The relations of the several fossil types of man and their
gradual progression are most accurately expressed by certain
skull angles and proportions, or indexes, which have been specially
devised for the purpose. The anthropometric criteria that
are of most importance in the study of living races, more or
less fail in regard to prehistoric man. The hair, complexion,
and eye-color are not preserved. The head breadth, as indicated
by the cephalic index, is substantially the same from
Pithecanthropus to the last Cro-Magnons. Stature on the other
hand varies from one to another ancient race without evincing
much tendency to grow or to diminish consistently. Often, too,
there is only part of a skull preserved. The following proportions
of the top or vault of the skull—the calvarium—are therefore
useful for expressing quantitatively the gradual physical
progress of humanity from its beginning.</p>

<p>Three anatomical points on the surface of the skull are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
pivots on which these special indexes and angles rest. One is
the <i>Glabella</i> (G in <a href="#figure07">figure 7</a>), the slight swelling situated between
the eyebrows and above the root of the nose. The second
is the <i>Inion</i> (I), the most rearward point on the skull. The
third is the <i>Bregma</i> (B) or point of intersection of the sutures
which divide the frontal from the parietal bones. The bregma
falls at or very near the highest point of the skull.</p>

<p>If now we see a skull lengthwise, or draw a projection of it,
and connect the glabella and the inion by a line GI, and the
glabella and the bregma by a line GB, an acute angle, BGI, is
formed. This is the “bregma angle.” Obviously a high vaulted
skull or one that has the superior point B well forward will
show a greater angle than a low flat skull or one with its summit
lying far back.</p>

</figure>

<p>Next, let us drop a vertical from the bregma to the line GI,
cutting it at X. Obviously the proportion which the vertical
line BX bears to the horizontal line GI will be greater or less
as the arch or vault of the brain case is higher or lower. This
proportion BX: GI, expressed in percentages, is the “calvarial
height index.”</p>

<p>If now we compute the proportion of the GX part of the line
GI to the whole of this line, we have the “bregma position
index”; that is, a numerical indication of how far forward on
the skull the highest point B lies. A sloping or retreating forehead
naturally tends to have the bregma rearward; whereas if
the frontal bone is nearly vertical, resulting in a high, domed
expanse of forehead, the bregma tends to be situated farther
forward, the point X shifts in the same direction, the distance
GX becomes shorter in comparison to the whole line GI, and
the “bregma position index” falls numerically.</p>

<p>The “frontal angle,” finally, is determined by drawing a line
GF from the glabella tangent to the most protruding part of
the frontal bone and measuring the angle between this and the
horizontal GI. A small frontal angle obviously means a receding
forehead.</p>

<p>All these data can be obtained from the mere upper fragment
of a skull; they relate to that feature which is probably of the
greatest importance in the evolution of man from the lower
animals—the development of the brain case and therefore of the
brain, especially of the cerebrum or fore-brain; and they define
this evolution rather convincingly. The table, which compiles
some of the most important findings, shows that progress has
been fairly steadily continuous in the direction of greater
cerebral development.</p>

<h3 id="section20">20. <span class="smcap">Race Origins</span></h3>

<p>Almost every one sooner or later becomes interested in the
problem of the origin of the human races and the history of
their development. We see mankind divided into a number of
varieties that differ strikingly in appearance. If these varieties
are modifications of a single ancestral form, what caused them
to alter, and what has been the history of the change?</p>

<p>In the present state of science, we cannot wholly answer these
important questions. We know very little about the causes that
change human types; and we possess only incomplete information
as to the history of races. Stray bits of evidence here and
there are too scattered to afford many helpful clues. The very
earliest men, as we know them from fossils, are too far removed
from any of the living varieties, are too primitive, to link very
definitely with the existing races, which can all be regarded
as intergrading varieties of a single species, <i>Homo sapiens</i>. In
the latter half of the Old Stone Age, in the Aurignacian period,
at a time estimated to have been from twenty to twenty-five thousand
years ago, we commence to encounter fossils which seem
to foreshadow the modern races. The so-called Grimaldi type
of man from this period possesses Negroid affinities, the contemporary
Cro-Magnon and perhaps Brünn types evince Caucasian
ones. But we know neither the origin nor the precise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
descendants of these fossil races.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> They appear and then vanish
from the scene. About all that we can conclude from this fragment
of evidence is that the races of man as they are spread
over the earth to-day must have been at least some tens of thousands
of years in forming. What caused them to differentiate,
on which part of the earth’s surface each took on its peculiarities,
how they further subdivided, what were the connecting
links between them, and what happened to these lost links—on
all these points the answer of anthropology is as yet incomplete.</p>

<p>It is no different in other fields of biology. As long as the
zoölogist or botanist reviews his grand classifications or the wide
sweep of organic evolution for fifty million years back, he seems
to obtain striking and simple results. When he turns his attention
to a small group, attempting to trace in detail its subvarieties,
and the relations and history of these, the task is seen
to be intricate and the accumulated knowledge is usually insufficient
to solve more than a fraction of the problems that
arise.</p>

<p>There is, then, nothing unusual in the situation of partial
bafflement in which anthropology still finds itself as regards
the human races.</p>

<h3 id="section21">21. <span class="smcap">Race Classification</span></h3>

<p>What remains is the possibility of making an accurate survey
of the living races in the hope that the relationships which a
classification brings out may indicate something as to the former
development of the races. If for instance it could be established
that the Ainu or aborigines of Japan are closely similar
in their bodies to the peoples of Europe, we would then infer
that they are a branch of the Caucasian stock, that their origin
took place far to the west of their present habitat, and that they
have no connection with the Mongolian Japanese among whom
they now live. This is working by indirect evidence, it is true;
but sooner or later that is the method to which science always
finds itself reduced.</p>

<p>The desirability of a trustworthy classification of the human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
races will therefore be generally accepted without further argument.
But the making of such a classification proves to be more
difficult than might be imagined. To begin with, a race is only
a sort of average of a large number of individuals; and averages
differ from one another much less than individuals. Popular
impression exaggerates the differences, accurate measurements
reduce them. It is true that a Negro and a north European
cannot possibly be confused: they happen to represent extreme
types. Yet as soon as we operate with less divergent races we
find that variations between individuals of the same race are
often greater than differences between the races. The tallest
individuals of a short race are taller than the shortest individuals
of a tall race. This is called <i>overlapping</i>; and it occurs
to such an extent as to make it frequently difficult for the
physical anthropologist to establish clear-cut types.</p>

<p>In addition, the lines of demarcation between races have time
and again been obliterated by interbreeding. Adjacent peoples,
even hostile ones, intermarry. The number of marriages in one
generation may be small; but the cumulative effect of a thousand
years is often quite disconcerting. The half-breeds or
hybrids are also as fertile as each of the original types. There
is no question but that some populations are nothing but the
product of such race crossing. Thus there is a belt extending
across the entire breadth of Africa of which it is difficult to say
whether the inhabitants belong to the Negro or to the Caucasian
type. If we construct a racial map and represent the demarcation
between Negro and Caucasian by a line, we are really misrepresenting
the situation. The truth could be expressed only
by inserting a transition zone of mixed color. Yet as soon as
we allow such transitions, the definiteness of our classification
begins to crumble.</p>

<p>In spite of these difficulties, some general truths can be discovered
from a careful race classification, and certain constant
principles of importance emerge from all the diversity.</p>

<h3 id="section22">22. <span class="smcap">Traits on Which Classification Rests</span></h3>

<p>Since every human being obviously possesses a large number
of physical features or traits, the first thing that the prospective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
classifier of race must do is to determine how much weight he
will attach to each of these features.</p>

<p>The most striking of all traits probably is <i>stature</i> or bodily
height. Yet this is a trait which experience has shown to be
of relatively limited value for classifactory purposes. The
imagination is easily impressed by a few inches when they show
at the top of a man and make him half a head taller or shorter
than oneself. Except for a few groups which numerically are
rather insignificant, there is no human race that averages less
than 5 feet in height. There is none at all that averages taller
than 5 feet 10 inches. This means that practically the whole
range of human variability in height, from the race standpoint,
falls within less than a foot. The majority of averages of
populations do not differ more than 2 inches from the general
human average of 5 feet 5 inches.</p>

<p>Then, too, stature has been proved to be rather readily influenced
by environment. Each of us is a fraction of an inch
taller when he gets up in the morning than when he goes to
bed at night. Two races might differ by as much as a couple
of inches in their heredity, and yet if all the individuals of
the shorter race were well nourished in a favorable environment,
and all those of the taller group were underfed and overworked,
the naturally shorter race might well be actually the
taller one.</p>

<p>The <i>cephalic index</i>, which expresses in percentage form the
ratio of the length and the breadth of the head, is perhaps the
most commonly used anthropological measurement.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It has certain
definite advantages. The head measurements are easily
made with accuracy. The index is nearly the same on the living
head and on the dead skull; or one is easily converted into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
other. This enables present and past generations to be compared.
The index is also virtually the same for men and for women,
for children and for adults. Finally, it seems to be little
affected by environment. The consequence is that head form
has been widely investigated. There are few groups of people
of consequence whose average cephalic index we do not know
fairly accurately. The difficulty about the cephalic index from
the point of view of race classification is that it does not yield
broad enough results. This index is often useful in distinguishing
subtypes, nation from nation, or tribe from tribe; but
the primary races are not uniform. There is, for instance, no
typical head form for the Caucasian race. There are narrow
headed, medium headed, and broad headed Caucasians. The
same is true of the American Indians, who are on the whole
rather uniform, yet vary much in head form.</p>

<p>The <i>nasal index</i>, which expresses the relation of length and
breadth of nose, runs much more constant in the great races.
Practically all Negroids are broad-nosed, practically all Caucasians
narrow-nosed, and the majority of peoples of Mongolian
affinities medium-nosed. But the nasal index varies according
to the age of the person; it is utterly different in a living individual
and a skull;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> it seems to reflect heredity less directly
than the cephalic index; and finally it tells us nothing about the
elevation or profile or general formation of the nose.</p>

<p><i>Prognathism</i>, or the degree of the protrusion of the jaws, is
a conspicuous feature of the profile, and would seem to be of
some historic importance as a sign of primitiveness, because all
other mammals are more prognathous than man. The trait also
has a general correlation with the fundamental racial types.
Negroes are almost all prognathous, people of Mongolian type
moderately so, Caucasians very slightly. Prognathism is however
difficult to measure or to denote in figures. Various apparatuses
have been devised without wholly satisfactory results.</p>

<p>The <i>capacity of the skull</i> is measured by filling it with shot
or millet seed. The latter yields figures that are lower by 50
or 100 c.c. The average, by shot measure, for males the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
over is about 1,450 to 1,500 c.c., for females about 10 per cent
lower. European males range from 1,500 to 1,600, Asiatic Mongoloids
but little less, American Indians and Polynesians from
1,400 to 1,500, Bushmen, Australians, Tasmanians, Negritos,
Veddas from 1,300 to 1,400. These last groups are all small
bodied. It appears that cranial capacity is considerably dependent
on bodily size. Slender as well as short races run to
small capacities. The heavy Bantu surpass the slighter framed
Sudanese, and Hindus stand well below European Caucasians;
just as the shorter Japanese average less than the Chinese.
Broad headed populations show greater cranial capacity than
narrow headed ones: Alpine Europeans (§ <a href="#section24">24</a>) generally surpass
Nordics in spite of their shorter stature. Individual
variability is also unusually great in this measurement. The
largest and smallest skulled healthy individuals of the same sex
in one population differ sometimes by 500, 600, or 700 c.c., or
more than one-third of the racial average. Overlapping between
races is accordingly particularly marked in cranial capacity.
Furthermore, the measurement obviously cannot be taken on the
living. In spite of its interest as an alleged and perhaps partially
valid index of mental faculty, cranial capacity is thus of
restricted value in distinguishing races.</p>

<p>The <i>texture of the hair</i> is now universally regarded as one
of the most valuable criteria for classifying races, possibly the
most significant of all. Hair is distinguished as woolly in the
Negro, straight in the Mongolian, and wavy or intermediate in
the Caucasian. This texture depends principally on the diameters
of each individual hair, as they are revealed in cross-section
under the microscope; in part also on the degree of
straightness or curvature of the root sacs of the hair in the
skin. Hair texture seems to run rather rigidly along hereditary
racial lines, and to be uninfluenced by factors of age, sex, climate,
or nourishment.</p>

<p><i>Hairiness</i> of the body as a whole is another trait to which
more and more attention is coming to be paid. The fullness or
scantiness of the beard, and the degree of development of the
down which covers the body, are its most conspicuous manifestations.
Caucasians are definitely a hairy race, Mongoloids and
most Negroids glabrous or smooth-skinned. It is largely on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
basis of their hairiness that races like the Australians have been
separated from the Negroids, and the Ainus from the Japanese.</p>

<p>Except possibly for stature, <i>color</i> is probably the most conspicuous
trait of any race. Under color must be included the
complexion of the skin, the color of the hair, and the color of
the eyes. All of these however present difficulties to the anthropometrist.
The pigment in every human skin is the same: it
differs only in amount. We have therefore a complete series
of transition shades, and it is difficult to express these differences
of shade quantitatively. They readily impress the eye,
but it is far from easy to denote them accurately in numbers.
Environment also affects skin color markedly. A day’s exposure
to the sun will darken an individual’s complexion by several
shades. In spite of these drawbacks, however, complexion
remains sufficiently important to have to be considered in every
classification.</p>

<p><i>Hair color and eye color</i> are practically immune against direct
change by environment. They unquestionably are excellent
hereditary criteria, although they offer much the same resistance
to measurement as does complexion. The utility of these two
traits is however limited by another factor: their narrow distribution.
Blue eyes and blond hair are racially characteristic
of only a single subrace, that of northern Europe. In central
Europe they are already much toned down: the prevailing type
here is brunet. In southern Europe, blue eyes and blondness
scarcely occur at all except where admixture with northern
peoples can be traced. Outside of the Caucasian stock, black
hair and black eyes are the universal rule for the human family.</p>

<p>Obviously it would be easiest to arrive at a clear-cut classification
by grouping all the peoples of the earth according to a
single trait, such as the shape of the nose, or color. But any
such classification must be artificial and largely unsound, just
because it disregards the majority of traits. The only classification
that can claim to rest upon a true or natural basis is
one which takes into consideration as many traits as possible,
and weights the important more heavily than the unimportant
features. If the outcome of such a grouping is to leave some
peoples intermediate or of doubtful place in the classification,
this result is unfortunate but must be accepted.</p>

<p>If now we follow this plan and review the peoples of the
earth, each with reference to all its physical traits, we obtain
an arrangement something like that which is given in the table
on the previous page. It will be seen that there are three
grand divisions, of which the European, the Negro, and the
Chinaman may be taken as representative. These three primary
classes are generally called Caucasian, Negroid, and Mongoloid.
The color terms, White, Black, and Yellow, are also often used,
but it is necessary to remember that they are employed merely
as brief convenient labels, and that they have no descriptive
value. There are millions of Caucasians who are darker in
complexion than millions of Mongoloids.</p>

<p>These three main groups account for more than nine-tenths
of all the nations and tribes of the world. As to the number
of individuals, they comprise probably 99 per cent of all human
beings. The aberrant forms are best kept separate. Some of
them, like the before-mentioned Ainu and Australians, appear
to affiliate preponderantly with one of the three great classes,
but still differ sufficiently in one or more particulars to prevent
their being included with them outright. Other groups, such
as the Polynesians, seem to be, at least in part, the result of a
mixture of races. Their constituent elements are so blended,
and perhaps so far modified after the blending, as to be difficult
to disentangle.</p>

<p>Each of the three great primary stocks falls into several
natural subdivisions.</p>

<h3 id="section24">24. <span class="smcap">Caucasian Races</span></h3>

<p>Three of the four Caucasian races live, in whole or part, in
Europe; the fourth consists of the Hindus.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The three European
races are the Nordic, the Alpine, and the Mediterranean.
Some authorities recognize a greater number, but all admit at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
least these three. They occupy horizontal belts on the map.
Beginning with the Nordic and ending with the Mediterranean
they may be described as successively darker skinned, darker
eyed, darker haired, and shorter in stature. The Alpine race,
which lies between the two others, is however more than a mere
transition; for it is broad headed, whereas the Nordic and Mediterranean
are both narrow or long headed. The Nordic type is
essentially distributed around the Baltic and North seas. The
Mediterranean race occupies the shores of the Mediterranean
Sea, in Asia and Africa as well as in Europe. In ancient times
it seems to have prevailed everywhere along these coasts. At
present the Balkan peninsula and Asia Minor are mostly occupied
by broad headed peoples of more or less close affinity to
the Alpines. This Alpine race is perhaps less homogeneous
than the two others. A central Frenchman, a Serb, a Russian,
and an Armenian are clearly far from identical (§ <a href="#section30">30</a>). They
have enough in common, however, to warrant their being put in
the one larger group.</p>

<p>It must be clearly understood that these races have nothing
to do with the modern political nationalities of Europe. Northern
Germany is prevailingly Nordic, southern Germany, Alpine.
Northern Italy is Alpine, the rest of the peninsula Mediterranean.
All three races are definitely represented in France.
The average north Frenchman stands racially nearer to the
north German than to his countryman from central France,
whereas the latter links up in physical type with the south
German. Nationality is determined by speech, customs, religion,
and political affiliations. Its boundary lines and those of race
cut right across one another.</p>

<p>The British Isles did not escape the process of race blending
that has gone on in Europe for thousands of years. The bulk
of the blood of their inhabitants during the past thousand years
has been Nordic, but there is an Alpine strain, and most authorities
recognize a definite “Iberian,” that is, Mediterranean
element. The first settlers in America carried this mixture
across the Atlantic, and through the years immigration has
increased its compositeness. Scandinavians and north Germans
have added to the Nordic component in the population of the
United States; south Germans, Austro-Hungarians, Russians,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
and Jews to the Alpine; the Italians have injected a definite
Mediterranean element. The Negro alone has not been admitted
into the make-up of our white society; but the reverse holds:
a considerable and growing percentage of the “colored” people
in the United States are from one-sixteenth to fifteen-sixteenths
Caucasian.</p>

<p>The Hindu is in the main a narrow headed, dark skinned
Caucasian, not very different from the Mediterranean. When
he entered India he probably found there an aboriginal population
which may have been Negroid but more likely was related
to the Australians or perhaps constituted a dark proto-Caucasian
or Indo-Australian race. A fairly thorough intermixture has
taken place in India during the last three thousand years, with
the result that the originally pure Caucasian type of the Hindu
has been somewhat modified, while most of the less numerous or
less vigorous aboriginal population has become submerged. The
definite Caucasian type is best preserved in the north; the traces
of the dark skinned aboriginal race are strongest in southern
India.</p>

<h3 id="section25">25. <span class="smcap">Mongoloid Races</span></h3>

<p>The Mongoloid stock divides into the Mongolian proper of
eastern Asia, the Malaysian of the East Indies, and the American
Indian. The differences between these three types are not very
great. The Mongolian proper is the most extreme or pronounced
form. It was probably the latest to develop its present characteristics.
For instance, the oblique or “Mongolian” eye is a
peculiarity restricted to the people of eastern Asia. The
original Mongoloid stock must be looked upon as having been
more like present-day Malaysians or American Indians, or
intermediate between them. From this generalized type peoples
like the Chinese gradually diverged, adding the epicanthic
fold of the oblique eye and other peculiarities, while the less
civilized peoples of America and Oceania kept more nearly to
the ancient type.</p>

<p>Within the East Indies, a more and a less specifically Mongoloid
strain can at times be distinguished. The latter has often
been called Indonesian. In certain respects, such as relatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
short stature and broad nose, it approaches the Indo-Australian
type described below. Among the American Mongoloids, the
Eskimo appears to be the most particularized subvariety.</p>

<h3 id="section26">26. <span class="smcap">Negroid Races</span></h3>

<p>The Negroid stock falls into two large divisions, the African
Negro proper, and the Oceanic Melanesian; besides a third division,
the Dwarf Blacks or Negritos, who are very few in numbers
but possess a wide and irregular distribution. The Negroes
and the Melanesians, in spite of their being separated by the
breadth of the Indian Ocean, are clearly close relatives. A
trained observer can distinguish them at sight, but a novice
would take a Papuan from New Guinea or a Melanesian from
the Solomon or Fiji Islands to be an African. Perhaps the
most conspicuous difference is that the broad nose of the African
Negro is flat, the broad nose of the Melanesian often aquiline.
How these two so similar Negroid branches came to be located
on the opposite sides of a great ocean is a fact that remains
unexplained.</p>

<p>The Negrito or Dwarf Negroid race has representatives in
New Guinea, in the Philippines, in the Malay Peninsula, in the
Andaman Islands, and in equatorial Africa. These peoples are
the true pygmies of the human species. Wherever they are
racially pure the adult males are less than 5 feet in stature.
They also differ from other Negroids in being relatively broad
headed. Their skin color, hair texture, nose form, and most
other traits are, however, the same as those of the other Negroids.
Their scattered distribution is difficult to account for.
It is possible that they are an ancient and primitive type which
once inhabited much wider stretches of territory than now in
Africa, Asia, and Oceania. On account of their inoffensiveness
and backwardness, the Negritos, according to this theory, were
gradually crowded to the wall by the larger, more energetic
populations with which they came in contact, until only a few
scattered fragments of them now remain.</p>

<p>The Bushmen and in some degree the Hottentots of South
Africa may also be provisionally included with the Negritos,
although distinctive in a number of respects. They are yellowish-brown<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
in complexion, long headed, short and flat eared, short
legged, hollow backed, and steatopygous. On the whole Negroid
characteristics prevail among them. They are, for instance,
frizzy-haired. Their extremely short stature may justify their
tentative inclusion among the Negritos.</p>

<h3 id="section27">27. <span class="smcap">Peoples of Doubtful Position</span></h3>

<p>One thing is common to the peoples who are here reckoned
as of doubtful position in the classification: they all present
certain Caucasian affinities without being similar enough to the
recognized Caucasians to be included with them. This is true
of the black, wavy-haired, prognathous, beetling-browed Australians,
whose first appearance suggests that they are Negroids,
as it is of the brown Polynesians, who appear to have Mongoloid
connections through the Malaysians. In India, Indo-China,
and the East Indies live a scattered series of uncivilized
peoples more or less alike in being dark, short, slender, wavy
haired, longish headed, broad nosed. The brows are knit, the
eyes deep set, the mouth large, beard development medium. Resemblances
are on the one hand toward the Caucasian type, on
the other toward the Australian, just as the geographical position
is intermediate. The name Indo-Australian is thus appropriate
for this group. Typical representatives are the Vedda of
Ceylon; the Irula and some of the Kolarian tribes of India;
many of the Moi of several parts of Indo-China; the Senoi or
Sakai of the Malay Peninsula; the Toala of Celebes. These are
almost invariably hill or jungle people, who evidently represent
an old stratum of population, pushed back by Caucasians or
Mongoloids, or almost absorbed by them. The dark strain in
India seems more probably due to these people than to any true
Negroid infusion. Possibly the Indo-Australians branched off
from the Caucasian stem at a very early time before the Caucasian
stock was as “white” as it is now. In the lapse of ages
the greater number of the Caucasians in and near Europe took
on, more and more, their present characteristics, whereas this
backward branch in the region of the Indian Ocean kept its
primitive and undifferentiated traits. This is a tempting theory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
to pursue, but it extends so far into the realm of the hypothetical
that its just appraisal must be left to the specialist.</p>

<h3 id="section28">28. <span class="smcap">Continents and Oceans</span></h3>

<p>One fact about the classification stands out clearly, namely,
that the three grand races are not limited to particular continents.
It is true that the center of gravity of the Caucasians
is in or near Europe, that the biggest block of Negroids is
situated in Africa, and the largest mass of Mongoloids in Asia.
It is even possible that these three types evolved on these three
continents. But each of them is <i>inter-continental</i> in its present
distribution. Western Asia and northern Africa as well as
Europe are Caucasian. There are Negroids in Oceania as well
as in Africa, and the Mongoloids are found over Oceania, Asia,
and both Americas.</p>

<p>In fact the distribution of the three primary races can better
be described as oceanically marginal than as continental. The
Caucasian parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa surround the
Mediterranean Sea. The African and the Oceanic branches of
the Negroid race are situated on the left and right sides of the
Indian Ocean. The Mongoloid habitat in Oceania, in eastern
Asia, and in North and South America almost encloses the
Pacific Ocean. (Figs. <a href="#figure10">10</a> and <a href="#figure11">11</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="section29">29. <span class="smcap">The History of Race Classifications</span></h3>

<p>Most of the early classifications of mankind tried to identify
races and continents too closely. The first attempt was that of
Linnæus in the middle of the eighteenth century. He distinguished
and described four varieties of mankind, which he called
<i>Europæus albus</i>, <i>Asiaticus luridus</i>, <i>Americanus rufus</i>, and <i>Afer
niger</i>; that is, European White, Asiatic Yellow, American Red,
African Black.</p>

<p>The next classification, that of Blumenbach in 1775, is essentially
the same except for adding a fifth or Oceanic variety.
Blumenbach’s five human races, the Caucasian, Mongolian,
Ethiopian, American, and Malayan, still survive in many of the
geographies of our elementary schools, usually under the designations
of White, Yellow, Black, Red, and Brown; but they no
longer receive scientific recognition.</p>

</figure>

<p>As time went on, the continental principle of race classification
came to be recognized as inadequate, and there was a tendency
among anthropologists to accept the distinctness of certain
specialized groups like the Australians, Bushmen, Eskimo, and
Ainu, which were often elevated into races substantially equal
in rank with the great races like the Mongoloid. Thus Peschel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
distinguished: (1) Mediterranean or Caucasian; (2) Mongoloid
(including the East Indians and Americans); (3) Negro;
(4) Australian; but then separated off (5) Dravida of southern
India; (6) Papuans, and (7) Hottentot-Bushmen, as if these
smaller groups were coördinate with the grand ones. Nott and
Gliddon also recognized seven races, although somewhat different
ones: European, Asiatic, Negro, American, Malay, Australian,
and Arctic. This is the fivefold scheme of Blumenbach with
Australian and Arctic added.</p>

<h3 id="section30">30. <span class="smcap">Emergence of the Threefold Classification</span></h3>

<p>On the other hand the feeling gained ground, especially as the
result of the labors of French anthropologists, that mankind
could be satisfactorily accounted for by a division into Caucasian,
Negroid, and Mongoloid. Those who adopted this principle
tried to fit divergent types like the Australians and Polynesians
into one or the other of these three great groups. Some
little doctoring had to be done in this process, and some salient
facts estimated rather lightly. It is for this reason that it has
seemed best here not to make our tripartite classification too
exhaustive. This threefold classification clearly absorbs the
great mass of mankind without straining, but it is soundest to
recognize that this same basic classification requires a certain
margin of extensions along the lines indicated in our table.</p>

<p>The classification made by the French anthropologist Deniker
is one of the most elaborate yet devised. It recognizes 6 grand
divisions, 17 minor divisions, and 29 separate races. The primary
criterion of classification is hair texture.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Deniker’s Classification</i></p>

<ul>
<li class="ifrst">A. Hair woolly, with broad nose.</li>
<li class="isub1">I. 1. Bushman.</li>

<li class="ifrst">D. Hair wavy to straight, with light eyes.</li>

<li class="isub2">16. North European.</li>
<li class="isub2">17. East European.</li>
<li class="ifrst">E. Hair wavy to straight, with dark eyes.</li>
<li class="isub1">XI. 18. Ainu.</li>
<li class="isub1">XII. Oceanian.</li>
<li class="isub2">19. Polynesian.</li>
<li class="isub2">20. Indonesian (East Indies).</li>
<li class="ifrst">F. Hair straight.</li>

<li class="isub2">24. Patagonian.</li>
<li class="isub1">XIV. 25. Eskimo.</li>
<li class="isub1">XV. 26. Lapp.</li>
<li class="isub1">XVI. Eurasian.</li>
<li class="isub2">27. Ugrian (E. Russia).</li>
<li class="isub2">28. Turco-Tartar (S.W. Siberia).</li>
<li class="isub1">XVII. 29. Mongol (E. Asia).</li>
</ul>

<p>In spite of its apparent complexity, this classification coincides
quite closely with the classification which is followed in
this book. Inspection reveals that Deniker’s grand division A
is Negroid, C and D Caucasian, F Mongoloid. Of his two
remaining grand divisions, B is intermediate between A and C,
that is, between Negroid and Caucasian, and consists of peoples<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
which are either, like the East Africans, the probable result of
a historical mixture of Negroids and Caucasians, or which, like
the Australians, share the traits of both, and are therefore
admitted to have a doubtful status. The other grand division,
E, is transitional between Caucasian D and Mongoloid F, and
the peoples of which it consists are those whom we too have
recognized as difficult to assign positively to either stock. In
short, Deniker’s classification is much the more refined, ours the
simpler; but essentially they corroborate one another.</p>

<h3 id="section31">31. <span class="smcap">Other Classifications</span></h3>

<p>Another classification that puts hair texture into the forefront
is that of F. Müller. This runs as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li class="ifrst">A. Ulotrichi or Woolly-haired.</li>
<li class="isub1">1. Lophocomi or Tuft-haired: Papua, Hottentot-Bushmen.</li>
<li class="isub1">2. Eriocomi or Fleecy-haired: African Negroes.</li>
<li class="ifrst">B. Lissotrichi or Straight-haired.</li>
<li class="isub1">3. Euthycomi or Stiff-haired: Australian, Malay, Mongolian, Arctic, American.</li>
<li class="isub1">4. Euplocomi or Wavy-haired: Dravidian (S. India), Nubian, (Sudan), “Mediterranean” (Europe, N. Africa, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>The distinction here made between the Tuft and Fleecy-haired
groups is unsound. It rests on a false observation: that a few
races, like the Bushmen, had their head-hair growing out of the
scalp only in spots or tufts. With the elimination of this group,
its members would fall into the Fleecy or Woolly-haired one,
which would thus comprise all admitted Negroids; whereas the
two remaining groups, the Stiff and Wavy-haired, obviously
correspond to the Mongoloid and Caucasian. The only remaining
peculiarity of the classification—and in this point also it
is unquestionably wrong—is the inclusion of the Australians
in the Stiff or Straight-haired group. But even this error
reflects an element of truth: it emphasizes the fact that in spite
of their black skins, broad noses, and protruding jaws, the Australians
are not straight-out Negroids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>The underlying feature of this classification, after allowing
for its errors, is that mankind consists of two rather than three
main branches: the Ulotrichi or Negroids, as opposed to the
Lissotrichi or combined Mongoloids and Caucasians. This basic
idea has been advocated by others. Boas, for instance, reckons
Mongoloids and Caucasians as at bottom only subtypes of a
single stock with which the Negroids and Australians are to be
contrasted.</p>

<p>Somewhat different in plan is Huxley’s scheme, which recognizes
four main races, or five including a transitional one.
These are (1) Australioids, including Dravidians and Egyptians;
(2) Negroids, with the Bushmen and the Oceanic
Papuans, Melanesians, Tasmanians, and Negritos as two subvarieties;
(3) Mongoloids, as customarily accepted; (4) Xanthochroi,
about equivalent to Nordics and Alpines; (5) Melanochroi,
nearly the same as the Mediterraneans, but supposed by
Huxley to be hybrid or intermediate between the Xanthochroi
and Australioids. This classification in effect emphasizes the
connection between Australoids and Caucasians, with the Negroids
as a distinctive group on one side and the Mongoloids
on the other.</p>

<p>Haeckel’s classification is basically similar, in that besides
the usual three primary stocks—which he elevates into species—he
recognizes a separate group comprising the Australians,
Dravidians, and Vedda-like Indo-Australians.</p>

<h3 id="section32">32. <span class="smcap">Principles and Conclusions Common to All Classifications</span></h3>

<p>It will be seen that in spite of the differences and uncertainties
as yet prevalent in any scheme for classifying the human
species, certain principles stand out both as regards method and
results; and in regard to these principles there is substantial
agreement.</p>

<p>First, any valid classification must rest on a combination of
as many traits or features as possible.</p>

<p>Second, several features of the human body are of definite significance
for the discrimination of races. Hair and hairiness
are unquestionably of great importance; stature, except in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
extreme cases, much less so. Color differences in the skin, hair,
or eyes are important but difficult to handle. Shape of nose
and prognathism are useful for rough classification. The
cephalic index possesses an exceptional utility in making the
finer discriminations.</p>

<p>Third, it is clearly impossible to find a simple and consistent
scheme within which all the varieties of man can be placed.
We must not attempt more than nature allows.</p>

<p>On the other hand the vast bulk of mankind does fall naturally
into three great divisions, each of which again subdivides
into three or four principal branches, in regard to whose distinctness
there is no serious difference of opinion. The scattering
remainder of races are allied sometimes to one primary
stock, sometimes to another, but always with some special
peculiarities.</p>

<p>From such a classification as this, especially after the accumulation
of large series of accurate measurements which will permit
its being worked out to greater exactness, we may hope
ultimately to reconstruct the full and true history of the races
of men, or, in any event, some reasonable hypothesis as to their
development. As yet, however, we are not in a position to
account for the origin of the races except speculatively.</p>

<h3 id="section33">33. <span class="smcap">Race, Nationality, and Language</span></h3>

<p>The term race has here been used in its biological sense, for
a group united in blood or heredity. A race is a subdivision
of a species and corresponds to a breed in domestic animals.
Popularly, the word is used in a different sense, namely that
of a population having any traits in common, be they hereditary
or non-hereditary, biological or social (Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_I">I</a>). It is customary,
but scientifically inaccurate, to speak of the French
race, the Anglo-Saxon race, the Gypsy race, the Jewish race.
The French are a nation and nationality, with a substantially
common speech; biologically, they are three races considerably
mixed, but still imperfectly blended (§ <a href="#section24">24</a>). Anglo-Saxon refers
primarily to speech, incidentally to a set of customs, traditions,
and points of view that are more or less associated with the
language. The Gypsies are a self-constituted caste, with folkways,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
occupations, and a speech of their own. The Jews, who
were once a nationality, at present, of course, form a religious
body, which somewhat variably, in part from inner cohesion
and in part from outer pressure, tends also to constitute a
caste. They evince little hereditary racial type, measurements
indicating that in each country they approximate the physical
type of the gentile population.</p>

<p>It may seem of little moment whether the word race is restricted
to its strict biological sense or used more loosely. In
fact, however, untold loose reasoning has resulted from the
loose terminology. When one has spoken a dozen times of
“the French race,” one tends inevitably to think of the inhabitants
of France as a biological unit, which they are not.
The basis of the error is confusion of organic traits and processes
with superorganic or cultural ones; of heredity with tradition
or imitation. That civilizations, languages, and nationalities go
on for generations is obviously a different thing from their
being caused by generation. Slovenly thought, tending to deal
with results rather than causes or processes, does not trouble
to make this discrimination, and every-day speech, dating from
a pre-scientific period, is ambiguous about it. We say not only
“generation,” when there is no intent to imply the reproductive
process, but “good breeding” (literally, good brooding or hatching
or birth), when we mean good home training or education;
just as we “inherit” a fortune or a name—social things—as well
as ineradicable traits like brown eye-color. Biology has secured
for its processes the exclusive use of the term “heredity”; and
biologists employ the term “race” only with reference to a
hereditary subdivision of a species. It is equally important that
the word be used with the same exact denotation in anthropology,
else all discussion of race degenerates irretrievably into
illogical sliding in and out between organic and social factors.
The inherently great difficulties which beset the understanding
and solution of what are generally called race problems, as discussed
in the next chapter, are considerably increased by a confusion
between what is and what is not racial and organic and
hereditary.</p>

<h3 id="section34">34. <span class="smcap">Questions of Endowment and Their Validity</span></h3>

<p>Are the human races alike or dissimilar in mentality and character?
Are some lower than others, or are they all on a plane
as regards potentiality? The answers to these questions are of
theoretical import, and naturally also bear on the solution of
the practical race problems with which many nations are confronted.</p>

<p>As long as an inquiry remains sufficiently abstract or remote,
the desirability of such inquiry is likely to go unquestioned.
As soon, however, as investigation touches conduct—for instance,
our actual relations with other races—a sentiment has a way of
rising, to the effect that perhaps after all the problem does not
so much call for knowledge as for action. Thus, in regard to
the negro problem in the United States, it is likely to be said
that the immediate issue is what may be the best attitude toward
“Jim Crow” cars and other forms of segregation. Are these
desirable or undesirable, fair or unfair? Here are specific problems
which an actual condition presses to have answered. Under
the circumstances, it will be said, is not an inquiry into the
innate capacity of the negro rather remote, especially when
every one can see by a thousand examples that the negro is
obviously inferior to the Caucasian? He is poorer, more shiftless,
less successful. He has made no inventions, produced no
geniuses. He clearly feels himself inferior and comports himself
accordingly. Why then raise the issue of capacity at all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
unless from a desire to befog it, to subvert the conclusions of
common sense and every-day experience by special pleading
which substitutes adroitness for sincerity? When a prisoner
has been found guilty it is the judge’s business to determine the
length of sentence, to decide how far justice should be tempered
with mercy. Were he to reopen the case from the beginning,
he would be showing partiality. Is not the situation of the scientist
proposing to inquire into the accepted verdict that the negro
is inferior to the Caucasian, analogous to that of a judge who
insists on setting aside the verdict of twelve unprejudiced jurymen
in order to retry the defendant himself? In some such
form as this, objections may rise in the minds of some.</p>

<p>The answer to such criticism is first of all that racial inferiority
and superiority are by no means self-evident truths.
Secondly, the belief in race inequalities is founded in emotion
and action and then justified by reasoning. That is, the belief
is rationalized, not primarily inferred by pure reason. It may
be true, but it is not proved true.</p>

<p>As to what is self-evident, there is nothing so misleading as
direct observation. We see the sun move and the earth stand
still. It is “self-evident” that the sun revolves around the
earth. Yet after thousands of years the civilized portion of
mankind finally came to believe that it was the earth that spun.
Science had no perverse interest, no insidious motive, in advocating
the Copernican instead of the Ptolemaic system; in fact,
was driven to its new belief gradually and reluctantly. It was
pre-scientific humanity, with its direct, homespun, every-day observation,
which had really prejudged the matter, and which,
because it had always assumed that the earth was flat and stationary,
and because every idiot could see that it was so, long
combated the idea that it could be otherwise.</p>

<p>As to opinions founded in emotion and subsequently rationalized,
instead of being evolved by pure reason from evidence,
it may suffice to quote from a famous book on herd instinct, as
to the relation of mass opinion and science:</p>

<p>“When, therefore, we find ourselves entertaining an opinion
about the basis of which there is a quality of feeling which tells
us that to inquire into it would be absurd, obviously unnecessary,
unprofitable, undesirable, bad form, or wicked, we may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
know that that opinion is a non-rational one, and probably,
therefore, founded upon inadequate evidence.</p>

<p>“Opinions, on the other hand, which are acquired as the result
of experience alone do not possess this quality of primary certitude.
They are true in the sense of being verifiable, but they
are unaccompanied by that profound feeling of truth which
belief possesses, and, therefore, we have no sense of reluctance
in admitting inquiry into them. That heavy bodies tend to fall
to the earth and that fire burns fingers are truths verifiable and
verified every day, but we do not hold them with impassioned
certitude, and we do not resent or resist inquiry into their basis;
whereas in such a question as that of the survival of death by
human personality we hold the favorable or the adverse view
with a quality of feeling entirely different, and of such a kind
that inquiry into the matter is looked upon as disreputable by
orthodox science and as wicked by orthodox religion. In relation
to this subject, it may be remarked, we often see it very interestingly
shown that the holders of two diametrically opposed
opinions, one of which is certainly right, may both show by their
attitude that the belief is held instinctively and non-rationally,
as, for example, when an atheist and a Christian unite in repudiating
inquiry into the existence of the soul.”</p>

<p>Take the attitude of the average Californian or Australian
about the Mongolian; of the Texan about the Mexican; of the
Southerner about the Negro; of the Westerner about the local
tribes of Indians; of the Englishman about the Hindu—is not
their feeling exactly described by the statement that inquiry into
the possibility of racial equality would be “unnecessary,”
“absurd,” or evilly motivated; and that their belief in
race superiority rests on an “a priori synthesis of the most
perfect sort,” and possesses “the quality of primary certitude”?</p>

<p>In short, the apparently theoretical beliefs held as to race
capacity by people who are actually confronted by a race conflict
or problem are by no means the outcome of impartial examination
and verification, but are the result of the decisions taken
and emotions experienced in the course of acts performed toward
the other race. The beliefs rest ultimately on impulse and feeling;
their reasoned support is a subsequent bolstering up. Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
course, the fact that a belief springs from emotion does not
render that belief untrue, but does leave it scientifically unproved,
and calling for investigation.</p>

<p>These conclusions may vindicate inquiry into the relative
capacity of races from the charge of being finespun, insidious,
impractical, or immoral.</p>

<h3 id="section35">35. <span class="smcap">Plan of Inquiry</span></h3>

<p>In approach to the problem, a consideration stands out. If
the human races are identical in capacity, or if, though not absolutely
alike, they average substantially the same in the sum
total of their capacities, then such differences as they have
shown in their history or show in their present condition must
evidently be the result mainly of circumstances external to
heredity. In that case, knowledge of the historical or environmental
circumstances, and analysis of the latter, become all-important
to understanding. On the other hand, if hereditary
racial inequalities exist, one can expect that the historical or
cultural influences, however great they may be, will nevertheless
tend to have their origin in the hereditary factors and to
reinforce them. In that case, differences between two groups
would be due partly to underlying heredity and partly to overlying
cultural forces tending on the whole in the same direction.
Yet even in that case, before one could begin to estimate the
strength of the true racial factors, the historical ones would
have to be subtracted. Thus, in either event, the first crux of
the problem lies in the recognition and stripping off of cultural,
social, or environmental factors, so far as possible, from the complex
mass of phenomena which living human groups present.
In proportion as these social or acquired traits can be determined
and discounted, the innate and truly racial ones will be
isolated, and can then be examined, weighed, and compared.
Such, at any rate, is a reasonable plan of procedure. We are
looking for the inherent, ineradicable elements in a social animal
that has everywhere built up around himself an environment—namely,
his culture—in which he mentally lives and
breathes. It is precisely because in the present inquiry we wish
to get below the effects of culture that we must be ready to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
concern ourselves considerably with these effects, actual or
possible.</p>

<h3 id="section36">36. <span class="smcap">Anatomical Evidence on Evolutionary Rank</span></h3>

<p>But first of all it may be well to consider the relatively simple
evidence which has to do with the physical form and structure
of race types. If one human race should prove definitely nearer
to the apes in its anatomy than the other races, there would be
reason to believe that it had lagged in evolution. Also there
would be some presumption that its arrears were mental as
well as physical.</p>

<p>But the facts do not run consistently. One thinks of the Negro
as simian. His jaws are prognathous; his forehead recedes; his
nose is both broad and low. Further, it is among Caucasians
that the antithetical traits occur. In straightness of jaws and
forehead, prominence and narrowness of nose, Caucasians in
general exceed the Mongoloids. Thus the order as regards these
particular traits is: ape, Negroid, Mongoloid, Caucasian. With
ourselves at one end and the monkey at the other, the scale
somehow seems right. It appeals, and seems significant. Facts
of this sort are therefore readily observed, come to be remembered,
and rise spontaneously to mind in an argument on race
differences.</p>

<p>However, there are numerous items that conflict with this
sequence. For instance, one of the most conspicuous differences
of man from the apes is his relative hairlessness. Of the three
main stocks, however, it is the Caucasian that is the most hairy.
Both Mongoloids and Negroids are more smooth-skinned on face
and on body.</p>

<p>In hair texture, the straight-haired Mongoloid is nearest the
apes, the wavy-haired Caucasian comes next, and the woolly
Negroid is the most characteristically human, or at least unsimian.</p>

<p>In the length of head hair, in which man differs notably from
the monkeys, the relatively short-haired Negro once more approximates
most closely to the ape, but the long-haired Mongoloid
surpasses the intermediate Caucasian in degree of departure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>Lip color reverses this order. The apes’ lips are thin and
grayish; Mongoloid lips come next; then those of Caucasians;
the full, vivid, red lips of the Negro are the most unapelike
of all.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to multiply examples. If one human racial
stock falls below others in certain traits, it rises above them in
other features, insofar as “below” and “above” may be measurable
in terms of degree of resemblance to the apes. The only
way in which a decision could be arrived at along this line of
consideration would be to count all features to see whether the
Negro or the Caucasian or the Mongoloid was the most unapelike
in the plurality of cases. It is possible that in such a
reckoning the Caucasian would emerge with a lead. But it is
even more clear that whichever way the majority fell, it would
be a well divided count. If the Negro were more apelike than
the Caucasian in all of his features, or in eight out of ten, the
fact would be heavily significant. With his simian resemblances
aggregating to those of the Caucasian in a ratio of say four to
three, the margin would be so close as to lose nearly all its
meaning. It is apparently some such ratio as this, or an even
more balanced one, that would emerge, so far as we can judge,
if it were feasible to take a census of all features.</p>

<p>It should be added that such a method of comparison as this
suffers from two drawbacks. First, the most closely related
forms now and then diverge sharply in certain particulars; and
second, a form which on the whole is highly specialized may
yet have remained more primitive, or have reverted to greater
primitiveness in a few of its traits, than relatively unevolved
races or species.</p>

<p>Thus, the anthropoid apes are brachycephalic, but all known
types of Palæolithic man are dolichocephalic. Matched against
the apes, the long-headed Negro would therefore seem to be the
most humanly specialized stock. Compared however with the
fossil human forms, the Negro is the most primitive in this feature,
and the Mongoloid and Alpine Caucasian could be said to
have evolved the farthest because their heads are the roundest.
Yet their degree of brachycephaly is approximately that of the
anthropoid apes. To which criterion shall be given precedence?
It is impossible to say. Quite likely the round-headedness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
the apes represents a special trait which they acquired since
their divergence from the common hominid ancestral stem. If
so, their round-headedness and that of the Mongoloids is simply
a case of convergent evolution, of a character repeating independently,
and therefore no evidence of Mongoloid primitiveness.
Yet, if so, the long-headedness common to the early human
races and the modern Negroids would probably also mean
nothing.</p>

<p>It is even clearer that other traits have been acquired independently,
have been secondarily evolved over again. Thus the
supraorbital ridges. When one observes the consistency with
which these are heavy in practically all Neandertal specimens;
how they are still more conspicuous in Pithecanthropus and
Rhodesian man; how the male gorilla shows them enormously
developed; and that among living races they are perhaps
strongest in the lowly Australian, it is tempting to look upon
this bony development as a definite sign of primitiveness. Yet
there is an array of contradicting facts. The youthful gorilla
and adult orang are without supraorbital development. The
male gorilla has his powerful brows for the same reason that he
has the crest along the top of his skull: they are needed as
attachments for his powerful musculature. They are evidently
a secondary sex character developed within the species. So
among fossil men there seem to have been two strains: one represented
by Pithecanthropus and Neandertal man and the Rhodesian
race, which tended toward supraorbital massiveness; and
another, of which Piltdown man is representative, which was
smooth of forehead. Among living races the Asiatic Mongoloids
lack marked supraorbital development; the closely related
American Indians possess it rather strongly; Caucasians and
Negroes show little of the feature; Australians most of all.
Evidently it would be unsafe to build much conclusion on either
the presence or absence of supraorbital ridges.</p>

<p>Perhaps these instances will suffice to show that even the mere
physical rating of human races is far from a simple or easy
task. It is doubtful whether as yet it is valid to speak of one
race as physically higher or more advanced, or more human
and less brutish, than another. This is not an outright denial
of the possibility of such differential ratings: it is a denial only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
of the belief that such differentials have been established as
demonstrable.</p>

<h3 id="section37">37. <span class="smcap">Comparative Physiological Data</span></h3>

<p>There is another angle of approach. This consists in abandoning
the direct attempt to rate the races in anatomical terms,
and inquiring instead whether they show any physiological differences.
If such differences can be found, they may then perhaps
be interpretable as differences in activity, responsiveness,
endurance, or similar constitutional qualities. If the bodies of
two races behave differently, we should have considerable reason
to believe that their minds also behaved differently.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we possess fewer data on comparative physiology
than on comparative anatomy. The evidence is more
fluctuating and intricate, and requires more patience to assemble.
Unfortunately, too, for the purposes of our inquiry, the races
come out almost exactly alike in the simpler physiological reactions.
The normal body temperature for Caucasian adults is
37° (98.5 F.), the pulse about 70, the respiration rate around
17 or 18 per minute. If the Negro’s temperature averaged even
a degree higher, one might expect him to behave, normally, a
little more feverishly, to respond to stimulus with more vehemence,
to move more quickly or more restlessly. Or, if the pulse
rate of Mongolians were definitely lower, they might be expected
to react more sluggishly, more sedately, like aging Caucasians.
But such observations as are available, though they are far
from as numerous as is desirable, reveal no such differences:
temperature, pulse, respiration, record the same as among Caucasians,
or differ so slightly, or so conflictingly, as to leave no
room for positive conclusions. Certainly if there existed any
important racial peculiarities, they would have been noted by
the physicians who at one time or another have examined millions
of Negroes, Chinese, Japanese, and thousands of Indians
and Polynesians.</p>

<p>Apparently there is only one record that even hints at anything
significant. Hrdlička, among some 700 Indians of the
Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico, found
the pulse to average about 60 per minute, or ten beats less than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
among whites. This would seem to accord with the general impression
of Indian mentality as stolid, reserved, slow, and steady.
But the number of observations is after all rather small; the
part of the race represented by them is limited; and the habitat
of the group of tribes is mostly a high plateau, and altitude
notoriously affects heart action. Considerable corroboration will
therefore be needed before any serious conclusions can be built
upon this suggestive set of data.</p>

<p>There are other physiological functions that are likely to mean
more than the rather gross ones just considered: for instance,
the activity of the endocrines or glands of internal secretion.
An excess or deficiency of activity of the thyroid, pituitary,
adrenals, and sex glands affects not only health, but the type of
personality and its emotional and intellectual reactions. For
example, cretinism with its accompaniment of near-idiocy is the
result of thyroidal under-development or under-functioning, and
is often cured by supplying the lack of thyroidal substance and
secretion. But this subject is as difficult as it is interesting; to
date, absolutely nothing is known about endocrine race differences.
It would be a relatively simple matter to secure first-hand
information on the anatomy of the endocrine glands in
Negroes as compared with whites; to ascertain whether these
differed normally in size, weight, shape, or structure, and how.
But this knowledge has scarcely been attempted systematically,
and still less is any knowledge available in the more delicate
and complex field of the workings of the organs. To be sure,
theories have been advanced that race differentiation itself may
be mainly the result of endocrine differentiations. There is
something fascinating about such conjectures, but it is well to
remember that they are unmitigated guesses.</p>

<h3 id="section38">38. <span class="smcap">Disease</span></h3>

<p>Pathology might seem to promise more than normal physiology.
So far as mortality goes, there are enormous differences
between races. And the mortality is often largely the result of
particular diseases. Measles, for instance, has often been a
deadly epidemic to uncivilized peoples, and smallpox has in some
regions at times taken toll of a quarter of the population in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
year or two. Yet it is short-sighted to infer from such cases
any racial predisposition or lack of resistance. The peoples in
question have been free for generations, perhaps for their entire
history, from these diseases, and have therefore not maintained
or acquired immunity. Their difference from us is thus essentially
in experience, not hereditary or racial. This is confirmed
by the fact that after a generation or two the same epidemics
that at first were so deadly to Polynesians or American Indians
sink to almost the same level of mild virulence as they show
among ourselves.</p>

<p>Then, too, immediate environment plays a part. The savage
often has no idea of contagion, and still less of guarding against
it; he thinks in terms of magic instead of physiology—and succumbs.
How far heavy mortality is the result of lack of resistance
or of fundamentally vicious treatment, is often hard to
say. If we tried to cure smallpox by subjecting patients to a
steam-bath and then having them plunge into a wintry river, we
should perhaps look upon the disease as a very nearly fatal
one to the Caucasian race.</p>

<h3 id="section39">39. <span class="smcap">Causes of Cancer Incidence</span></h3>

<p>It may be worth while to consider briefly the facts as to mortality
from cancer. This dread disease appears to be not contagious,
so that the factor of acquired immunity is eliminated.
It is regarded as incurable, except by operation, so that differences
in treatment become relatively unimportant. If therefore
significant differences in racial liability to cancer exist, they
should emerge with unusual clearness and certainty.</p>

<p>At first sight they seem to. It has been alleged that the white
race is the most susceptible to this affliction. The supporting
figures are as follows: cancer deaths per year per 100,000
population.</p>

<p>That the relative incidence is more than a temporary accident
is shown by the approximate recurrence of the frequencies after
ten years.</p>

<p>In proportion as latitude and occupation influence the occurrence
of cancer, race is diminished as a cause. It is reduced still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
further by other considerations. The rate for Austria in 1906-10
was 78, for Hungary 44. Here the race is the same: the difference
must be social. Austria averaged higher in wealth, education,
medical development. This fact would tend to have a
double effect. First, among the more backward population, a
certain proportion would die of internal cancers difficult to
diagnose, without the cause being recognized, owing to insufficient
medical treatment. Second, the general death rate would
be higher. More children and young people would die of infectious
or preventable disease, leaving fewer survivors to die of
cancer in middle and old age. Wherever, on the other hand, a
public is medically educated, and typhoid, smallpox, diphtheria,
tuberculosis claim fewer victims, the proportion of those dying
of cancer, nephritis, heart diseases, increases. Such an increase
is noted everywhere, and goes hand in hand with a longer
average life. The alarm sometimes felt at the modern “increase”
of cancer is therefore unfounded, because it is perhaps mainly
apparent. If a larger percentage of the population each year
died of old age, it would be a sign that sanitation and medicine
were increasingly effective: evidence that more people lived to
become old, not that age debility was spreading.</p>

<p>Consequently, a high degree of modern civilization must tend
to raise the cancer rate; and any group of people will seem relatively
immune from cancer in proportion as they remain removed
from attaining to this civilization. In Hungary, from
1901-04, the cancer deaths were 239 among the owners of large
farms, 41 among the owners of small farms; 108 among employing
blacksmiths, 25 among their employees; 114 among employing
tailors, 32 among employed tailors. Obviously these pairs
of groups differ chiefly in their economic and cultural status.</p>

<p>Here too lies the explanation of why the South African negro
shows a rate of only 14, the United States negro of 56; also why
the Chinese rate is as low as 5 in Hongkong, rises to 19 in
Manila, and 26 in Hawaii, while the closely allied Japanese
average 62 for the whole of Japan—as compared with 50 for
Spain, which is pure Caucasian, but one of the most backward
countries in Europe. In Tokyo and Kyoto the rate soars to 73
and 90 respectively, just as in the United States it is about 10
higher for the urban than for the rural population.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Within the United States, also, the rate rises and falls almost
parallel for whites and Negroes according to locality; as,</p>

<p>If allowance is made for the facts that the negro population
of the United States is poorer and less educated than the white;
that it lives mainly in lower latitudes; and that it tends to be
rural rather than urban, the comparative cancer death rates for
the country of negro 56 and white 77 would appear to be accounted
for, without bringing race into consideration.</p>

<p>In short, what at first glance, or to a partisan pleader, would
seem to be a notable race difference in cancer liability, turns out
so overwhelmingly due to environmental and social causes as to
leave it doubtful whether racial heredity enters as a factor at
all. This is not an assertion that race has nothing whatever to
do with the disease; it is an assertion that in the present state
of knowledge an inherent or permanent connection between
race and cancer incidence has not been demonstrated. If
there is such a connection, it is evidently a slight one, heavily
overlaid by non-racial influences; and it may be wholly lacking.</p>

<p>The case would be still less certain for most other diseases, in
which environmental factors are more directly and obviously
influential. Racial medical science is not impossible; in fact it
should have an important future as a study; but its foundations
are not yet laid.</p>

<h3 id="section40">40. <span class="smcap">Mental Achievement and Social Environment</span></h3>

<p>One point will have become clear in the course of the foregoing
discussion: namely, how far the difficulty of coming to
positive conclusions is due to the two sets of interacting causal
factors, the hereditary ones and the environmental ones that
play upon heredity. The environmental factors are themselves
a composite of geographical influences and of the economic, cultural,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
and other social influences that human beings exert upon
each other.</p>

<p>If this intermingling of distinct kinds of causes is true of
races when considered from the side of physiology and medicine,
it is evident that the intermingling will be even more intricate
in the mental sphere. After all, bodily functioning varies only
within fairly definite limits. When external influences press too
strongly upon the innate nature of the organism, the latter ceases
to function and dies. The mind, on the other hand, however
much its structure may be given by heredity, depends for its
content wholly on experience, and this experience can be thoroughly
varied. Individuals of the same organic endowment may
conceivably be born either in the uppermost stratum of a highly
refined civilization, or among the most backward and remote
savages. Whether this actually happens, and to what degree, is
of course precisely the problem which we are trying to solve.
But that it is theoretically and logically possible cannot be denied;
and here a vicious circle of reasoning begins. One argument
says: there have been no recognized geniuses among peoples
like the Hottentots, and the sum total of their group achievement
is ridiculously small; therefore it is clear that the Hottentot
mind must be inferior. The opposite argument runs:
Hottentot cultural environment is so poor and limited that the
finest mind in the world reared under its influence would grow
up relatively sterile and atrophied; therefore it is probable that
the mind of the Hottentot is intrinsically identical with our
own, or at least of equivalent capacity, and that Hottentot
geniuses have actually been born but have been unable to flourish
as geniuses.</p>

<p>Evidently the same facts are before those who advocate these
opposite views, but these facts are viewed from diametrically
opposite sides. If one starts to travel around the logical circle
in one direction, one can keep revolving indefinitely and find
ever fresh supporting evidence. If, however, one begins to
revolve around the same circle of opinion in the opposite direction,
it is just as easy and just as compelling to continue to think
in this fashion and to find all testimony corroborative.</p>

<p>In such a situation it is possible to realize that from the point
of view of proof, or objective truth, one view is worth as much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
as the other: which is nothing. It is an emotional bias that
inclines one man toward the conviction of race superiority and
another to that of race equality. The proofs in either case are
for the most part a mere assembling of ex parte testimony. It
is easy enough to advocate impartiality. The difficulty is in
being impartial; because both the hereditary and the environmental
factors are in reality unknown quantities. What we have
objectively before us is such and such a race or group of people,
with such and such present traits and historical record. These
phenomena being the product of the interaction of the two sets
of causes, we could of course, if we knew the strength of one,
compute the strength of the other. But as we have isolated
neither, we are dealing with two indeterminate variables. Evidently
the only way out of the dilemma, at any rate the only
scientific way, is to find situations in which one of the factors
is, for the time being, fixed. In that case the strength of the
other factor will of course be proportionate to the attainments
of the groups.</p>

<p>Actually, such instances are excessively difficult to find. There
are occasional individuals with identical heredity, namely, twins
produced from the division of a single ovum. In such twins,
the strength of environmental influences can be gauged by the
difference in their careers and achievements. Yet such twins
are only individuals, and it is illegitimate to make far-reaching
inferences from them to larger groups, such as the races. It is
conceivable that heredity might on the whole be a more powerful
cause than environment, and racial groups still average substantially
alike in their heredity. Because a natively gifted and a
natively stunted individual within the group vary conspicuously
in achievement, even under similar environment, it does not follow
that races differ in germ-plasm because they differ in
achievements.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, one sets out to discover cases of identical
environment for distinct racial strains, the task quickly
becomes even more difficult. Very little analysis usually suffices
to show that the environment is identical only up to a certain
point, and that beyond this point important social divergences
begin. Thus, so far as geographical environment goes, the Negro
and the white in the southern United States are under the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
conditions. There is also uniformity of some of the gross externals
of cultural environment. Both Negroes and whites speak
English; are Christians; plant corn; go to the circus; and so
on. But, just as obviously, there are aspects in which their
social environment differs profoundly. Educational opportunities
are widely different. The opportunity of attaining leadership
or otherwise satisfying ambition is wide open to the white,
and practically closed to the Negro. The “color-line” inevitably
cuts across the social environment and makes of it two different
environments.</p>

<p>It might be said that the southern United States furnish an
extreme case of a sharply drawn color-line. This is true. But
on the other hand there is no place on earth where something
corresponding to a color-line is not drawn between two races
occupying the same territory. It sometimes happens that distinctions
are diminished and faintly or subtly enforced, as in
modern Hawaii, where to outward appearances many races
dwell together without discrimination. Yet examination reveals
that the absence of discrimination is only legal and perhaps
economic. As regards the relations and associations of human
beings, the welcome which they extend or the aloofness which
they show to one another, there is always a color-line. This
means not only difference in opportunity, but difference in
experience, habit formation, practices, and interests.</p>

<h3 id="section41">41. <span class="smcap">Psychological Tests on the Sense Faculties</span></h3>

<p>This factor of experience enters even into what appear to be
the simplest mental operations, the sensory ones. The scant
data available from experimental tests indicate that a variety
of dark skinned or uncivilized peoples, including Oceanic and
African Negroids, Negritos, Ainus, and American Indians, on
the whole slightly surpass civilized whites in keenness of vision
and fineness of touch discrimination, whereas the whites are
somewhat superior in acuity of hearing and sensitiveness to pain.
Yet what do these results of measurements mean?</p>

<p>Vision is tested for its distance ability. The farther off one
can distinguish objects or marks, the higher one’s rating.
Civilized man reads—normally—at 14 inches. He works with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
sharp knives, with machines that are exact; he is surrounded
by things made with such exact machines; he handles thin paper
and filmy fabrics. His women sew and embroider with the
sharpest of needles, the finest of thread. Everything about us
tends toward close accuracy and away from the haziness of distant
observation. The savage, on the other hand, the half-civilized
person even, inspects the horizon, watches for game or
its dim tracks, tries to peer to the bottom of streams for fish.
He does not read, his needles are blunt, his thread is cord, his
carving without precision even though decorative, the lines he
makes are free-hand and far-apart. He is trained, as it were,
for the usual vision tests. If the psychologist reversed his experiment
and sought the degree of power to see fine differences
at close range, it is possible that the savage might prove inferior
because untrained by his experience. Such tests seem not to
have been made. Until they are, and again show uncivilized
man superior, there is no real proof that innate racial differences
of serious moment exist.</p>

<p>The whole act of vision in fact involves more than we ordinarily
think. After all, seeing is done with the mind as well
as with the eye. There is the retinal image, but there is also
the interpretation of this image. A sailor descries the distant
shore, whereas the landsman sees only a haze on the horizon.
To the city dweller a horse and a cow a mile off are indistinguishable.
Not so to the rancher. There is something almost
imperceptible about the profile of the feeding end of the animal,
about its movement, that promptly and surely classes it. At still
longer ranges, where the individual animals have wholly faded
from sight, a herd of cattle may perhaps be told from one of
horses, by the plainsman, through the different clouds of dust
which they kick up, or the rate of motion of the cloud. An
hour later when the herd is reached and proves to be as said,
the astonished traveler from the metropolis is likely to credit
his guide’s eyes with an intrinsic power greater than his field
glasses—forgetting the influence of experience and training.</p>

<p>In keenness of hearing, on the contrary, one should expect the
civilized white to come out ahead, as in fact he does; not because
he is Caucasian but because he is civilized and because the instruments
of experimentation, be they tuning forks or ticking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
watches or balls dropped on metal plates, are implements of
civilization. Make the test the howl of a distant wolf, or the
snapping of a twig as the boughs bend in the wind, and the
college student’s hearing might prove duller than that of the
Indian or Ainu. There is a story of a woodsman on a busy
thoroughfare, amid the roar of traffic and multifarious noise
of a great city, hearing a cricket chirp, which was actually discovered
in a near-by open cellar. Extolled for his miraculous
keenness of audition, the man in the fur cap dropped a small
coin on the pavement: at the clink, passers-by across the street
stopped and looked around.</p>

<p>As to the pain sense, an introspective, interpretative element
necessarily enters into experiments. What constitutes pain?
When the trial becomes disagreeable? When it hurts? When
it is excruciating? The savage may physiologically feel with
his nerve ends precisely as we do. But being reared to a life
of chronic slight discomforts, he is likely to think nothing of the
sensation until it hurts sharply; whereas we signal as soon as
we are sure that the experience is becoming perceptibly unpleasant.</p>

<p>In short, until there shall have been more numerous, balanced,
and searching tests made, it must be considered that nothing
positive has been established as to the respective sensory faculties
of the several human races. The experiments performed
are tests not so much of race as of the average experience and
habits of groups of different culture.</p>

<h3 id="section42">42. <span class="smcap">Intelligence Tests</span></h3>

<p>If this is true as regards the sense faculties, it might be expected
to hold to a greater degree of those higher mental faculties
which we call intelligence; and such is the case. Intelligence
tests have been gradually evolved and improved, the best known
being the Binet-Simon series. These are arranged to determine
the mental age of the subject. Their most important function
accordingly has been the detection of defective adults or backward
children. During the World War, psychological examinations
were introduced on a scale unheard of before. The purpose
of these examinations was to assign men to the tasks best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
commensurate with their true abilities; especially to prevent the
unfit from being entrusted with responsibility under which
they would break down and bring failure on larger undertakings.
Men subject to dizziness were to be kept from flying; those
unable to understand orders, out of active line service. The
tests throughout were practical. They tried to decide whether a
given man was fit or unfit. They did not pretend to go into the
causes of his fitness or unfitness. This is an important point.
Whatever illumination the army intelligence tests shed on the
problem of race intelligence is therefore indirect. Different
racial or national groups represented in the examinations attain
different capacity ratings, but there is nothing in the results
themselves to show whether they are due to racial or environmental
factors. Evidence on this point, if it can be derived at all
from the tests, has to be “analyzed out.”</p>

<p>In general, examinees in the United States were rated by being
assigned, on the basis of their scores, to grades which were
lettered from A to E, with plus and minus subgrades. The most
comprehensive presentation of results is to express the percentage
of individuals in each group that made the middle grade C,
better than C, and worse than C. On this basis we find:</p>

</table>

<p>These figures at face value seem to show deep group differences
in intelligence; and these face values have been widely
accepted. The reason is that they flatter national and race
egotism. To be sure, the Englishmen in the American draft
make a better showing than the drafted men at large; but this
has been complacently explained by saying that the English
represent in comparative purity the Anglo-Saxon or Nordic
stock which is also the dominant strain among Americans, but
which has been somewhat contaminated in their case by the
immigration of Latins and Slavs, who rate much lower, as shown
by the Italians and Poles tested. Lowest of all, as might be
expected, is the Negro. So runs the superficial but satisfying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
interpretation of the figures—satisfying if one happens to be of
North European ancestry.</p>

<p>But there is one feature that raises suspicion. The Italians
and the Poles are too close to the Negroes. They stand much
nearer to them in intelligence, according to these figures, than
they do to the white Americans. Can this be so—at least, can
it have racial significance? Are these Mediterraneans, descendants
of the Romans, and these Alpines, so large a strain of
whose blood flows in the veins of many white Americans, only
a shade superior to the Negro? Scarcely. “Something must
be wrong” with the figures: that is, they contain another factor
besides race.</p>

<p>A little dissection of the lump results reveals this factor.
The northern Negro far surpasses the southern in his showing.
He gets ten times as high a proportion of individuals into the
above-average grades, only half as many into the below-average.
Evidently the difference is due to increased schooling, improved
earning capacity, larger opportunity and incentive: social environment,
in short. So strong is the influence of the environment
that the northern Negro easily surpasses the Italian in
America.</p>

<p>Evidently the psychological tests are more a gauge of educational
and social opportunity than of race, since the Italian,
although brunet, is of course a pure Caucasian.</p>

<p>This conclusion is reinforced by another consideration. The
type of test first used in the army had been built up for reasonably
literate people, speaking English. Among such people
it discriminated successfully between the more and the less fit.
But the illiterate and the foreigner knowing no English failed
completely—not because their intelligence was zero, but because
the test involved the use of non-congenital abilities which they
had not acquired. A second set of tests, known as Beta, was
evolved for those who were obviously ineligible, or proved
themselves so, for the old style of test, which was designated as
Alpha. The illiteracy of the subjects given the Beta test was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
most cases not an absolute one. Men who could not write an
intelligible letter or read the newspaper or who had had only
half or less of the ordinary grammar school education, together
with aliens whose comprehension of English remained imperfect,
were put in the group of “illiterates” or badly educated. Separating
now the literates from the illiterates among a number
of racial, national, or sectional groups, we find:</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that the two groups were not set
apart as the result of tests, but that the two tests were devised
to meet the problem of treating the two groups with reasonable
uniformity. The point was to find the excellent man, and the
unfit man, with the same degree of accuracy whether he was
literate or illiterate. When found, he was assigned to the same
grade, such as A, or D—, whether his examination had been
Alpha or Beta.</p>

<p>Now let us observe some of the figures. The New York negro
is nearly on a par with the Alabama white, among literates, and
a bit ahead of him among illiterates. Approximately the two
groups come out the same; which means that bringing up in a
certain part of the country has as much to do with intelligence,
even in the rough, as has Caucasian or colored parentage.</p>

<p>The literate negroes of the draft, irrespective of section,
slightly surpass the illiterate whites.</p>

<p>In every case the literate members of a race or nationality
make a far better showing than the illiterate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>It is now clear also that the important factor of education
enters so heavily into the first figures cited that they can mean
little if anything as to inherent capacity. Of the Englishmen
tested, nine-tenths fell in the literate group; of the Poles, a fifth;
of the Italians, a seventh. In the draft generally, nearly three-fourths
of the whites were literate; of the negroes, less than a
third.</p>

<p>In short, in spite of the fact that the Beta test was intended
to equalize conditions for the illiterate and semi-illiterate, the
outstanding conclusion of the army examinations seems to be that
education—cultural advantage—enormously develops faculty.</p>

<p>Is there anything left that can positively be assigned to race
causation? It may be alleged that within the same section the
white recruits regularly surpass the colored. Alabama whites
may rate disappointingly, but they do better than Alabama
negroes; New York negroes show surprisingly well, but they
are inferior to New York whites; illiterate whites from the whole
country definitely surpass illiterate negroes; and still more so
among literates. But is this residuum of difference surely
racial? As long as the color-line remains drawn, a differential
factor of cultural advantage is included; and how strong this is
there is no present means of knowing. It is possible that some
of the difference between sectionally and educationally equalized
groups of whites and negroes is really innate and racial. But
it is also possible that most or all of it is environmental. Neither
possibility can be demonstrated from the unrefined data at
present available.</p>

<h3 id="section43">43. <span class="smcap">Status of Hybrids</span></h3>

<p>In nearly all tests of the American Negro, full bloods and
mixed bloods are not discriminated. Evidently if races have
distinctive endowments, the nature of these endowments is not
cleared up so long as individuals who biologically are seven-eighths
Caucasian are included with pure Negroes merely because
in this country we have the social habitude of reckoning them all
as “colored.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, an excellent opportunity to probe deeper
is being lost through the failure to classify tested colored people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
according to the approximate proportion of Negro blood. Suppose
for instance that on a given examination whites scored an
average of 100 and Negroes of 60. Then, if this difference were
really due to race, if it were wholly a matter of superior or
inferior blood, mulattos should average 80 and quadroons 90;
unless intelligence were due to simple Mendelian factors, in
which case its inheritance would tend to segregate, and of this
there is no evidence. Suppose, however, that instead of the
theoretically expectable 80 and 90, the mulattos and quadroons
scored 65 and 68. In that event it would be clear that the major
part of the Negro’s inferiority of record was due to environment;
that the white man’s points from about 70 up to 100 were
clearly the result of his superior social opportunities, whereas
the range between 60 and 70 approximately represented the
innate difference between Negro and Caucasian. This is a hypothetical
example, but it may serve to illustrate a possible method
of attacking the problem.</p>

<p>There are however almost no data of this kind; and when they
are obtained, they will be subject to certain cautions upon interpretation.
For instance, in the army examinations one attempt
was made to separate a small group of colored recruits into a
darker-skinned group, comprising full blooded Negroes and those
appearing to be preponderantly of Negro blood; and a lighter
complexioned group, estimated to contain the mulattos and individuals
in whom white ancestry was in excess. The light group
made the better scores. In the Alpha test for literates it attained
a median score of 50, the dark Negroes only 30; in the
Beta tests for illiterates, the respective figures were 36 and 29.</p>

<p>The caution is this. Is the mulatto subject to any more advantageous
environment than the full blooded Negro? So far as
voting and office-holding, riding in Pullman cars and occupying
orchestra seats in theatre are concerned, there is no difference:
both are colored, and therefore beyond the barrier. But the
mulattos of slavery days were likely to be house servants,
brought up with the master’s family, absorbing manners, information,
perhaps education; their black half-brothers and half-sisters
stayed out in the plantation shacks. Several generations
have elapsed since those days, but it is possible, even probable,
that the descendants of mulattos have kept a step or two ahead<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
of the descendants of the blacks in literacy, range of experience,
and the like.</p>

<p>It is impossible to predict what the social effect of miscegenation
will be. The effect undoubtedly varies and must be examined
in each case. Thus, Indian half-breeds in one tribe may
usually be the result of wholly transient or mercenary unions
between inferior whites and debauched native women and may
therefore grow up in an atmosphere of demoralization to which
the full blooded Indian is less exposed. This demoralization
would, to be sure, affect character and not intelligence as such;
but it might stand in the way of schooling, and otherwise indirectly
react on measurable traits of mind. In another tribe or
section of a tribe, to the contrary, the half-breed might normally
grow up in the house of a permanently settled white
father, a squaw man, and in that event would learn English
better, go to school earlier, and in case of a test therefore
achieve a higher rating than the full blood.</p>

<h3 id="section44">44. <span class="smcap">Evidence from the Cultural Record of Races</span></h3>

<p>An entirely different method of approach to the problem of
race capacity is that of examining the cultural record, the
achievements in civilization, of groups. While this approach is
theoretically possible, and while it is often attempted, it is subject
to little control and therefore unlikely to yield dependable
conclusions.</p>

<p>First of all, the culture history record of a people must be
known for considerable periods before one may validly think of
inferring therefrom anything as to the faculties of that people.
The reason is that active civilization, as a productive process, is
slow to grow up, slow to be acquired. Mere momentum would
normally keep the more advanced of two peoples ahead of the
other for a long time. In proportion as not nations but groups
of nations were involved, the momentum would continue for
still longer periods. Civilization flourished for some thousands
of years in the Near East, and then about the Mediterranean,
before it became established with equal vigor and success in
northern Europe. Had Julius Cæsar or one of his contemporaries
been asked whether by any sane stretch of phantasy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
he could imagine the Britons and Germans as inherently the
equals of Romans and Greeks, he would probably have replied
that if these northerners possessed the ability of the Mediterraneans
they would long since have given vent to it, instead of
continuing to live in disorganization, poverty, ignorance, rudeness,
and without great men or products of the spirit. And,
within limits, Cæsar would have been right, since it was more
than a thousand years before northern Europe began to draw
abreast of Italy in degree and productivity of civilization. Two
thousand years before Christ, a well informed Egyptian might
reasonably have disposed in the same sweeping way of the possibility
of Greeks and Italians being the equals of his own people in
capacity. What had these barbarians ever done to lead one to
think that they might yet do great things? To-day we brush
Negroes and Indians out of the reckoning with the same offhandedness.</p>

<p>In general, arguing from performance to potentiality, from
accomplishment to achievement, is valid under conditions of set
experiment—such as are impossible for races—or in proportion
as the number and variety of observations is large. A single
matched competition may decide pretty reliably as between the
respective speed capacities of two runners. But it would be
hazardous to form an opinion from a casual glimpse of them in
action, when one might happen to be hastening and the other
dallying. Least of all would it be sound to infer that essential
superiority rested with the one that was in advance at the moment
of observation, without knowledge of their starting points,
the difficulty of their routes, the motive or goal of their courses.
It is only as the number of circumstances grows, from which
observations are available, that judgment begins to have any
weight. The runner who has led for a long time and is increasing
his lead, or who has repeatedly passed others, or who carries
a load and yet gains ground, may lay some claim to superiority.
In the same way, as between races, a long and intimate historical
record, objectively analyzed, gives some legitimate basis for
tentative conclusions as to their natural endowment. But how
long the record must be is suggested by the example already
cited of Mediterranean versus Nordic cultural preëminence.</p>

<p>The fallacy that is most commonly committed is to argue from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
what in the history of great groups is only an instant: this
instant being that at which one’s own race or nationality is
dominant. The Anglo-Saxon’s moment is the present; the
Greek’s, the age of Pericles. Usually, too, the dominance holds
only for certain aspects: military or economic or æsthetic superiority,
as the case may be; inferiorities on other sides are
merely overlooked. The Greek knew his venality, but looked
down on the barbarian nevertheless. Anglo-Saxon failure in
the plastic and musical arts is notorious, but does not deter
most Anglo-Saxons from believing that they are the elect in
quality, and from buttressing this conviction with the evidences
of present industrial, economic, and political achievements—and
perhaps past literary ones.</p>

<h3 id="section45">45. <span class="smcap">Emotional Bias</span></h3>

<p>Inference from record to potentiality where the record of
one’s own group is favorable, and failure to draw such inference
where the achievement of other groups is superior, is a combination
of mental operations that is widely spread because it arises
spontaneously in minds not critically trained. Here is an instance:</p>

<p>One of the great achievements of science in the nineteenth
century was Galton’s demonstration, in a series of works beginning
with “Hereditary Genius,” that the laws of heredity apply
to the mind in the same manner and to the same degree as to
the body. On the whole this proof has failed to be recognized
at its true importance, probably because it inclines adversely to
current presuppositions of the independence of the soul from
the body, and freedom of the will, propositions to which most
men adhere emotionally.</p>

<p>From this perfectly valid demonstration, which has been confirmed
by other methods, Galton went on to rate the hereditary
worth of various races, according to the number of their men of
genius. Here a fallacy enters: the assumption that all geniuses
born are recognized as such. A great work naturally requires a
great man, but it presupposes also a great culture. It may be
that, historically speaking, a great genius cannot arise in a primitive
degree of civilization. That is, the kind of concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
accomplishment which alone we recognize as a work of genius
is culturally impossible below a certain level. Biologically the
individual of genius may be there; civilizationally he is not
called forth, and so does not get into the record. Consequently
it is unsound to argue from the historical record to biological
worth. However, this Galton did; and his method led him to the
conclusion that the negro rates two grades lower than the Englishman,
on a total scale of fourteen grades, and the Englishman
two lower than the fifth century Athenian.</p>

<p>This conclusion has never been popular. Most people on
becoming familiar with Galton’s argument, resist it. Its fallacy
is not easy to perceive—if it were, Galton would not have committed
it—and the average person is habitually so vague-minded
upon what is organic and what is social, that the determination
of the fallacy would be well beyond him. His opposition to
Galton’s conclusion is therefore emotionally and not rationally
founded, and his arguments against the conclusion are presumably
also called forth by emotional stimulus.</p>

<p>On the other hand, most individuals of this day and land do
habitually infer, like Galton, from cultural status to biological
worth, so far as the Negro is concerned. The same persons who
eagerly accept the demonstration of a flaw in the argument in
favor of Athenian superiority, generally become skeptical and
resistive to the exposition of the same flaw in the current belief
as to Negro inferiority. It is remarkable how frequently and
how soon, in making this exposition, one becomes aware of the
hearer’s feeling that one’s attitude is sophistical, unreal, insincere,
or motivated by something concealed.</p>

<p>The drift of this discussion may seem to be an unavowed argument
in favor of race equality. It is not that (§ <a href="#section271">271</a>). As a
matter of fact, the bodily differences between races would appear
to render it in the highest degree likely that corresponding
congenital mental differences do exist. These differences might
not be profound, compared with the sum total of common human
faculties, much as the physical variations of mankind fall within
the limits of a single species. Yet they would preclude identity.
As for the vexed question of superiority, lack of identity would
involve at least some degree of greater power in certain respects
in some races. These preëminences might be rather evenly distributed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
so that no one race would notably excel the others in the
sum total or average of its capacities; or they might show a
tendency to cluster on one rather than on another race. In
either event, however, the fact of race difference, qualitative if
not quantitative, would remain.</p>

<p>But it is one thing to admit this theoretical probability and
then stop through ignorance of what the differences are, and
another to construe the admission as justification of mental attitudes
which may be well founded emotionally but are in considerable
measure unfounded objectively.</p>

<p>In short, it is a difficult task to establish any race as either
superior or inferior to another, but relatively easy to prove
that we entertain a strong prejudice in favor of our own racial
superiority.</p>

<h3 id="section46">46. <span class="smcap">Summary</span></h3>

<p>It would seem that the subject of race problems, that is, the
natural endowment of human races, can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>The essential difficulty of these problems lies in the fact that
the performance of groups is the product of two sets of factors,
biological and cultural, both of which are variable and not
always readily separable.</p>

<p>Progress in solution of the problems will be made gradually,
and will be hastened by recognition of how few positive determinations
have been made.</p>

<p>Most of the alleged existing evidence on race endowment is
likely to be worthless.</p>

<p>The remainder probably has some value, but to what degree,
and what it demonstrates, cannot yet be asserted.</p>

<p>The most definite determinations promise to eventuate from
experiment. If fully controlled experiments in breeding and
rearing human beings could be carried out, the problems would
soon begin to solve. Experiments on animals would prove practically
nothing because animals are cultureless—uninfluenced by
social environment of their own making.</p>

<p>Progress will be aided by increasing shift of attention from
the crude consideration of comparative lump rating of the races,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
that is, their gross superiority or inferiority, to a consideration of
such specific qualitative differences as they may prove to show.
The question of finding the race in which the greatest number
of qualitative excellences are concentrated is subsequent and of
much less scientific importance.</p>

<p>Scientific inquiries into race are for the present best kept apart
from so-called actual race problems. These problems inevitably
involve feeling, usually of considerable strength, which tends
to vitiate objective approach. On the other hand, the practical
problems will no doubt continue to be met practically, that is,
morally and emotionally. Whether the Japanese should be forbidden
to hold land and the Negro be legally disfranchised are
problems of economics and of group ethics, which probably will
for a long time be disposed of emotionally as at present, irrespective
of the possible findings of science upon the innate endowment
of Caucasian, Mongoloid, and Negroid strains.</p>

<h3 id="section47">47. <span class="smcap">Linguistic Relationship: The Speech Family</span></h3>

<p>The question that the historian and anthropologist are likely
to ask most frequently of the philologist, is whether this and
that language are or are not related. Relationship in such connection
means descent from a common source, as two brothers
are descended from the same father, or two cousins from a
common grandfather. If languages can be demonstrated to
possess such common source, it is clear that the peoples who
spoke them must at one time have been in close contact, or perhaps
have constituted a single people. If, on the other hand,
the languages of two peoples prove wholly dissimilar, though
their racial types and cultures be virtually identical, as indeed
is sometimes found to be the case—witness the Hungarians and
their neighbors—it is evident that an element of discontinuous
development must somewhere be reckoned with. Perhaps one
part of an originally single racial group gradually modified its
speech beyond recognition, or under the shock of conquest, migration,
or other historical accident entirely discarded it in favor
of a new and foreign tongue. Or the opposite may be true: the
two groups were originally distinct in all respects, but, being
brought in contact, their cultures interpenetrated, intermarriage
followed, and the two physical types became assimilated into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
one while the languages remained dissimilar. In short, if one
wishes full understanding of a people, one must take its language
into consideration. This means that it must be classified. If a
historical classification is to be more than barrenly logical, it
must have reference to relationship, development, origin. In
a word, it must be a genetic classification.</p>

<p>The term used to indicate that two or more languages have a
common source but are unrelated to all others, or seem so in the
present state of knowledge, is “linguistic family.” “Linguistic
stock” is frequently used as a synonym. This is the fundamental
concept in the classification of languages. Without a clear idea
of its meaning one involves himself in confusion on attempting
to use philology as an aid to other branches of human history.</p>

<p>There is no abstract reason against referring to a group of
unrelated languages as a “family” because they are all spoken
in one area, nor against denominating as “families,” as has
sometimes been done, the major subdivisions of a group of languages
admittedly of common origin. Again, languages that
show certain similarities of type or structure, such as inflection,
might conceivably be put into one “family.” But there is this
objection to all such usages: they do not commit themselves on
the point of genetic relationship, or they contradict it, or only
partially exhaust it. Yet commonness of origin is so important
in many connections that it is indispensable to have one term
which denotes its ascertainable presence. And for this quality
there happens to be no generally understood designation other
than “linguistic family,” or its synonym, “linguistic stock.”
This phrase will therefore be used here strictly in the sense of
the whole of a group of languages sprung from a single source,
and only in that sense. Other groupings will be indicated by
phrases like “languages of such and such an area,” “subfamily,”
“division of a family,” or “languages of similar type.”</p>

<h3 id="section48">48. <span class="smcap">Criteria of Relationship</span></h3>

<p>The question that first arises in regard to linguistic families
is how the relationship of their constituent idioms is determined.
In brief, the method is one of comparison. If a considerable
proportion of the words and grammatical forms of two languages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
are reasonably similar, similar enough to indicate that the resemblances
cannot be due to mere accident, these similar words
and forms must go back to a common source, and if this source
is not borrowing, the two tongues are related. If comparison
fails to bring out any such degree of resemblance, the languages
are classed in distinct families.</p>

<p>Of course it is possible that the reason two languages seem
unrelated is not that they are really so, but that they have in
the lapse of ages become so much differentiated that one cannot
any longer find resemblance between their forms. In that event
true relationship would be obscured by its remoteness. Theoretically
there is high probability that many families of languages,
customarily regarded as totally distinct, do go back in
the far past to a common origin, and that ignorance of their
history, or inability to analyze them deeply, prevents recognition
of their relationship. From time to time it happens that
groups of languages which at first seemed unrelated are shown
by more intensive study to possess elements enough in common
to compel the recognition of their original unity. In that case
what were supposed to be several “families” become merged in
one. The scope of a particular family may be thus enlarged;
but the scope of the generic concept of “family” is not altered.</p>

<p>Whether there is any hope that comparative philology may
ultimately be prosecuted with sufficient success to lead all the
varied forms of human speech back to a single origin, is an
interesting speculation. A fair statement is that such a possibility
cannot be denied, but that the science is still far from
such a realization, and that progress toward it is necessarily
slow. Of more immediate concern is an ordering and summarizing
of the knowledge in hand with a view to such positive inferences
as can be drawn.</p>

<p>In an estimate of the similarity of languages, words that
count as evidence must meet two requirements: they must be
alike or traceably similar in sound; and they must be alike or
similar in meaning. This double requirement holds, whether full
words or separable parts of words, roots or grammatical forms, are
compared. The English word <i>eel</i> and the French <i>île</i>, meaning
island, are pronounced almost exactly alike, yet their meaning
is so different that no sane person would regard them as sprung<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
from the same origin. As a matter of fact <i>île</i> is derived from
Latin <i>insula</i>, whereas <i>eel</i> has a cognate in German <i>aal</i>. These
prototypes <i>insula</i> and <i>aal</i> being as different in sound as they are
in meaning, any possibility that <i>eel</i> and <i>île</i> might be related is
easily disposed of. Yet if the Latin and German equivalents
were lost, if nothing were known of the history of the English
and French languages, and if <i>île</i> meant not <i>island</i> but, say,
<i>fish</i> or <i>watersnake</i>, then it might be reasonable to think of a
connection.</p>

<p>Such doubtful cases, of which a certain proportion are likely
to be adjudged wrongly, are bound to come up in regard to
the less investigated languages, particularly those of nations
without writing, the earlier stages of whose speech have perished
without trace. In proportion as more is known of a language,
or as careful analysis can reconstruct more of its past stages,
the number of such borderline cases obviously becomes fewer.</p>

<p>Before genetic connection between two languages can be
thought of, the number of their words similar in sound and
sense must be reasonably large. An isolated handful of resemblances
obviously are either importations—loan words—or the
result of coincidence. Thus in the native Californian language
known as Yuki, <i>ko</i> means <i>go</i>, and <i>kom</i> means <i>come</i>. Yet examination
of Yuki reveals no further instances of the same kind.
It would therefore be absurd to dream of a connection: one
swallow does not make a summer. This lone pair of resemblances
means nothing except that the mathematical law of
probability has operated. Among the thousands of words in one
language, a number are likely to be similar in sound to words
of another language; and of this number again a small fraction,
perhaps one or two or five in all, will happen to bear some resemblance
in meaning also. In short, the similarities upon which
a verdict of genetic relationship is based must be sufficiently
numerous to fall well beyond possibility of mere coincidence;
and it must also be possible to prove with reasonable certainty
that they are not the result of one language borrowing words
from another, as, for instance, English borrowed from French
and Latin.</p>

<p>At the same time it is not necessary that the similarities
extend to the point of identity. In fact, too close a resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
between part of the stock of two languages immediately raises
a presumption of borrowing. For every language is continually
changing, and once a mother tongue has split into several
branches, each of these goes on modifying its sounds, and gradually
shifting the meaning of its words, generation after generation.
In short, where connection is real, it must be veiled by
a certain degree of distortion.</p>

<p>Take the English word <i>foot</i> and the Latin word of the same
meaning, <i>pes</i>. To offhand inspection the sounds or forms of the
two words do not seem similar. The resemblance becomes more
definite in other forms of <i>pes</i>, for instance the genitive case
<i>ped-is</i> or the accusative <i>ped-em</i>. Obviously the stem or elementary
portion of the Latin word is not <i>pes</i> but <i>ped-</i>; and the
<i>d</i> is closer to the English <i>t</i> of <i>foot</i> than is the <i>s</i> of <i>pes</i>. The
probability of relationship is increased by the Greek word for
foot, <i>pous</i>, whose stem proves to be <i>pod-</i>, with vowel closer to
that of English. Meanwhile, it would be recognized that there
are English words beginning with <i>ped-</i>, such as <i>pedal</i>, <i>pedestrian</i>,
<i>pedestal</i>, all of which have a clear association with the
idea of foot. All these words however possess almost exact
equivalents in Latin. One would therefore be justified in concluding
from these facts what indeed the history of the languages
proves, namely, that <i>pedal</i>, <i>pedestrian</i>, and <i>pedestal</i> are
Latin words taken over into English; whereas <i>foot</i> and <i>pes</i> and
<i>pous</i>, and for that matter German <i>fuss</i>, are derivatives from a
common form which once existed in the now extinct mother
tongue from which Greek and Latin and English and German
are derived.</p>

<h3 id="section49">49. <span class="smcap">Sound Equivalences and Phonetic Laws</span></h3>

<p>The question next arises whether it is possible to account for
the distortions which have modified the original word into <i>foot</i>,
<i>ped-</i>, etc. What has caused the initial sound of this ancient
word to become <i>p</i> in Latin and <i>f</i> in English, and its last consonant
to be <i>d</i> in Latin and Greek, <i>t</i> in English, and <i>ss</i> in German?
To answer this seemingly innocent question with accuracy
for this one word alone would involve a treatise on the whole
group of languages in question, and even then the causes, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
causes, could scarcely be set down with certainty. But it has
proved possible to assemble a large number of instances of
parallel distortion in which Latin <i>p</i> corresponds to English <i>f</i>,
or <i>d</i> to <i>t</i>. Evidently philology has got hold of a generalized
phenomenon here. Since <i>father</i> corresponds to <i>pater</i>, <i>full</i> to
<i>pl-enus</i>, <i>for</i> to <i>pro</i>, <i>fish</i> to <i>piscis</i>, and so on in case after case,
we are evidently face to face with a happening that has occurred
with regularity and to which the name “law” is therefore
applicable.</p>

<p>The <i>f</i> of <i>foot</i> and <i>p</i> of <i>pes</i> are both lip sounds. They differ
preëminently in that <i>f</i> can be prolonged indefinitely, whereas <i>p</i>
is a momentary sound. It is produced by closure of the lips
for a fraction of a second during which there is an interruption
of sound production, followed by a somewhat explosive release
of the breath which has been impounded in the mouth cavity.
This explosion is of necessity instantaneous. Since it is preceded
by occlusion, or stoppage of the breath, it is customary to speak
of sounds produced by a process like <i>p</i> as “stops.” <i>F</i>, on the
other hand, is a “continuant,” or more specifically a “fricative.”</p>

<p>The English word <i>three</i> begins with a sound which, although
conventionally represented by the two letters <i>th</i>, is a simple
sound and in a class with <i>f</i> in being fricative. <i>Th</i> is formed by
putting the tongue lightly across the teeth, just as <i>f</i> is made by
placing the lower lip against the edge of the upper teeth. In
both cases the breath is expelled with friction through a narrow
passage. Now if the fricative <i>f</i> is represented in Latin by the
stop <i>p</i>, then, if regularity holds good, the English fricative <i>th</i>
ought to be represented in Latin by the stop sound in the corresponding
dental position, namely <i>t</i>. The Latin word for <i>three</i>
is in fact <i>tres</i>; for <i>thin</i>, <i>ten-uis</i>; for <i>mother</i>, <i>mater</i>; for <i>thou</i>,
<i>tu</i>, and so on. The regularity therefore extends beyond the
limits of the single labial class of sounds, and applies with equal
force to the dentals; and, it may be added, to the palatals or
gutturals as well.</p>

<p>As one passes from English and Latin to German, one finds
the initial sound of the word meaning three, <i>drei</i>, to be somewhat
different from <i>th</i> and <i>t</i> but still clearly allied, since it also
is made by the tongue against the teeth. <i>D</i> is a stop like <i>t</i>, but
the vocal cords vibrate while it is being pronounced, whereas in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
<i>t</i> the vocal cords are silent. <i>D</i> is “voiced” or “sonant,” <i>t</i>
“unvoiced” or “surd.” Hence the formulation: Latin, surd
stop; German, sonant stop; English, fricative. This triple
equivalence can be substantiated in other words. For instance,
<i>ten-uis</i>, <i>dünn</i>, <i>thin</i>; <i>tu</i>, <i>du</i>, <i>thou</i>.</p>

<p>If it is the English word that contains a surd stop, what will
be the equivalent in Latin and German? Compare <i>ten</i>, Latin
<i>decem</i>, German <i>zehn</i>. Again the three classes of sounds run
parallel; but the place of their appearance in the three languages
has shifted.</p>

<p>The third possible placing of the three sounds in the three
languages is when English has the sonant stop, <i>d</i>. By exclusion
it might be predicted that Latin should then show the fricative
<i>th</i> and German the surd stop <i>t</i>. The word <i>daughter</i> confirms.
The German is <i>tochter</i>. Latin in this case fails us, the original
corresponding stem having gone out of use and been replaced
by the word <i>filia</i>. But Greek, whose sounds align with those of
Latin as opposed to English and German, provides the <i>th</i> as
expected: <i>thygater</i>. Compare <i>death</i>, <i>tod</i>, <i>thanatos</i>.</p>

<p>Let us bring together these results so that the eye may grasp
them:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Latin, Greek</td>
    <td>surd stop</td>
    <td>sonant stop</td>
    <td>fricative</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>German</td>
    <td>sonant stop</td>
    <td>fricative</td>
    <td>surd stop</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>English</td>
    <td>fricative</td>
    <td>surd stop</td>
    <td>sonant stop</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="pad-top">
    <td>Latin, Greek</td>
    <td>tres</td>
    <td>duo</td>
    <td>thygater</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>German</td>
    <td>drei</td>
    <td>zwei</td>
    <td>tochter</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>English</td>
    <td>three</td>
    <td>two</td>
    <td>daughter</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>These relations apply not only to the dentals <i>d</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>th</i> (<i>z</i>), which
have been chosen for illustration, but also to the labials, <i>p</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>f</i>,
and to the palatals <i>k</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i> (<i>gh</i>, <i>ch</i>).</p>

<p>It is evident that most of the sounds occur in all three groups
of languages, but not in the same words. The sound <i>t</i> is common
to English, Latin, and German, but when it appears in a particular
word in one of these languages it is replaced by <i>d</i> and
<i>th</i> in the two others. This replacing is known as a “sound
shift.” The sound shifts just enumerated constitute the famous
Grimm’s Law. This was the first discovered important phonetic
law or system of sound substitutions. Yet it is only one of a
number of shifts that have been worked out for the Indo-European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
group of languages to which English, German, and
Latin belong. So far, only stopped and fricative consonants
have been reviewed here, and no vowels have been considered.
Other groups of languages also show shifts, but often different
ones, as between <i>l</i> and <i>n</i>, or <i>s</i> and <i>k</i>, or <i>p</i> and <i>k</i>.</p>

<p>The significance of a shift lies in the fact that its regularity
cannot be explained on any other ground than that the words in
which the law is operative must originally have been the same.
That is, Latin <i>duo</i>, German <i>zwei</i>, English <i>two</i> are all only
variants of a word which meant “two” in the mother tongue
from which these three languages are descended. This example
alone is of course insufficient evidence for the existence of such
a common mother tongue. But that each of the shifts discussed
is substantiated by hundreds or thousands of words in which it
holds true, puts the shift beyond the possibility of mere accident.
The explanation of coincidence is ruled out. The resemblances
therefore are both genuine and genetic. The conclusion
becomes inevitable that the languages thus linked are later modifications
of a former single speech.</p>

<p>It is in this way that linguistic relationship is determined.
Where an ancient sound shift, a law of phonetic change, can be
established by a sufficient number of cases, argument ceases. It
is true that when most of a language has perished, or when an
unwritten language has been but fragmentarily recorded or its
analysis not carried far, a strong presumption of genetic unity
may crowd in on the investigator who is not yet in a position
to present the evidence of laws. The indications may be strong
enough to warrant a tentative assumption of relationship. But
the final test is always the establishment of laws of sound equivalence
that hold good with predominating regularity.</p>

<h3 id="section50">50. <span class="smcap">The Principal Speech Families</span></h3>

<p>The number of linguistic families is not a matter of much
theoretical import. From what has already been said it appears
that the number can perhaps never be determined with absolute
accuracy. As knowledge accumulates and dissection is carried
to greater refinements, new phonetic laws will uncover and serve
to unite what now seem to be separate stocks. Yet for the practical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
purpose of classification and tracing relationship the linguistic
family will remain a valuable tool. A rapid survey of
the principal families is therefore worth while.</p>

<p>In Asia and Europe, which must be considered a unit in this
connection, the number of stocks, according to conservative reckoning,
does not exceed twenty-five. The most important of these,
in point of number of speakers, is the Indo-European or Indo-Germanic
or Aryan family, whose territory for several thousand
years has comprised southwestern Asia and the greater part, but
by no means all, of Europe. The most populous branches of the
Indo-European family are the Indic, Slavic, Germanic, and Romance
or Latin. Others are Persian or Iranic, Armenian, Greek,
Albanian, Baltic or Lithuanian, and Keltic. From Europe
various Indo-European languages, such as English, Spanish,
French, Russian, have in recent centuries been carried to other
continents, until in some, such as the Americas and Australia,
the greater area is now inhabited by peoples speaking Indo-European.
As the accompanying maps are intended to depict
the historic or native distribution of languages they do not show
this diffusion. It will be noted that the distribution of Indo-European
has the form of a long belt stretching from western
Europe to northeastern India, with an interruption only in Asia
Minor (<a href="#figure12">Fig. 12</a>). Turkish peoples displaced Indo-Europeans
there about a thousand years ago, thus breaking the territorial
continuity. It is probable that another link between the western
and eastern Indo-Europeans once stretched around the north of
the Caspian sea. Here also there are Turks now.</p>

<p>Almost equaling Indo-European in the number of its speakers
is Sinitic, which is generally held to include Chinese proper
with its dialects; the Tibeto-Burman branch; the T’ai or Shan-Siamese
branch; and probably some minor divisions like Lolo.</p>

<p>In extent of territory occupied the Altaic stock rivals the Indo-European.
Its three main divisions, Turkish, Mongolian, and
Tungus-Manchu, cover most of northern and central Asia and
some tracts in Europe. The Turks, as just noted, are the only
stock that within the period of history has gained appreciable
territory at Indo-European expense. The Uralic or Finno-Ugric
family has eastern Europe and northwestern Asia as its
home, with the Finns and Hungarian Magyars as its most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
civilized and best known representatives. This is a scattered
stock. Most scholars unite the three Altaic divisions, Finno-Ugric,
and Samoyed into a vast Ural-Altaic family.</p>

<p>Of the Semitic family, Arabic is the chief living representative,
with Abyssinian in Africa as a little known half-sister.
Arabic is one of the most widely diffused of all languages,
and as the orthodox vehicle of Mohammedanism has served an
important function as a culture carrier. Several great nations
of ancient times also spoke Semitic tongues: the Babylonians,
Assyrians, Phœnicians, Carthaginians, and Hebrews.</p>

<p>Southern India is Dravidian. While people of this family
enter little into our customary thoughts, they number over fifty
millions. Japanese and Korean also merit mention as important
stock tongues. Anamese, by some regarded as an offshoot from
Chinese, may constitute a separate stock. Several minor families
will be found on the Asiatic map, most of them consisting of
uncivilized peoples or limited in their territory or the number
of their speakers. Yet, so far as can be judged from present
knowledge, they form units of the same order of independence
as the great Indo-European, Semitic, and Ural-Altaic stocks.</p>

<p>Language distributions in Africa are in the main simple
(<a href="#figure13">Fig. 13</a>). The whole of northern Africa beyond latitude 10°,
and parts of east Africa almost to the equator, were at one time
Hamitic. This is the family to which the language of ancient
Egypt belonged. Hamitic and Semitic, named after sons of
Noah, probably derive from a common source, although the
separation of the common mother tongue into the African
Hamitic and the Asiatic Semitic divisions must have occurred
very anciently. In the past thousand years Hamitic has yielded
ground before Semitic, due to the spread of Arabic in Mohammedan
Africa.</p>

<p>Africa south of the equator is the home of the great Bantu
family, except in the extreme southwest of the continent.
There a tract of considerable area, though of small populational
density, was in the possession of the backward Bushmen and
Hottentots, distinctive in their physical type as well as languages.</p>

</figure>

<p>Between the equator and latitude ten north, in the belt known
as the Sudan, there is much greater speech diversity than elsewhere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
in Africa. The languages of the Sudan fall into several
families, perhaps into a fairly large number. Opinion conflicts
or is unsettled as to their classification. They are, at least in
the main, non-Hamitic and non-Bantu; but this negative fact
does not preclude their having had either a single or a dozen
origins. It has usually been easier to throw them all into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
vague group designated as non-Hamitic and non-Bantu than to
compare them in detail.</p>

<p>In Oceania conditions are similar to those of Africa, in that
there are a few great, widely branching stocks and one rather
small area, New Guinea, of astounding speech diversity. Indeed,
superficially this variety is the outstanding linguistic feature of
New Guinea. The hundreds of Papuan dialects of the island
look as if they might require twenty or more families to accommodate
them. However, it is inconceivable that so small a population
should time and again have evolved totally new forms of
speech. It is much more likely that something in the mode of
life or habits of mind of the Papuans has favored the breaking
up of their speech into local dialects and an unusually rapid
modification of these into markedly differentiated languages.
What the circumstances were that favored this tendency to
segregation and change can be only conjectured. At any rate,
New Guinea ranks with the Sudan, western North America, and
the Amazonian region of South America, as one of the areas of
greatest linguistic multiplicity.</p>

<p>All the remainder of Oceania is either Australian or Malayo-Polynesian
in speech. The Australian idioms have been imperfectly
recorded. They were numerous and locally much varied,
but seem to derive from a single mother tongue.</p>

<p>All the East Indies, including part of the Malay Peninsula,
and all of the island world of the Pacific—Polynesia, Micronesia,
and Melanesia—always excepting interior New Guinea—are the
habitat of the closely-knit Malayo-Polynesian family, whose
unity was quickly recognized by philologists. From Madagascar
to Easter Island this speech stretches more than half-way
around our planet. Some authorities believe that the Mon-Khmer
languages of southern Indo-China and the Kolarian or
Munda-Kol tongues of India are related in origin to Malayo-Polynesian,
and denominate the larger whole, the Austronesian
family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>North and South America, according to the usual reckoning,
contain more native language families than all the remainder
of the world. The orthodox classification allots about seventy-five
families to North America (some fifty of them represented
within the borders of the United States) and another seventy-five
to South America. They varied greatly in size at the time
of discovery, some being confined to a few hundred souls,
whereas others stretched through tribe after tribe over enormous
areas. Their distribution is so irregular and their areas so disproportionate
as to be impossible of vivid representation except
on a large-scale map in colors. The most important in extent
of territory, number of speakers, or the cultural importance of
the nations adhering to them, are, in North America, Eskimo,
Athabascan, Algonkin, Iroquoian, Muskogean, Siouan, Uto-Aztecan,
Maya; and in South America, Chibcha, Quechua,
Aymara, Araucanian, Arawak, Carib, Tupi, Tapuya. It will be
seen on the maps (Figs. <a href="#figure14">14</a>, <a href="#figure15">15</a>) that these sixteen groups held
the greater part of the area of the double continent, the remaining
smaller areas being crowded with about ten times as many
stocks. Obviously, as in New Guinea, there cannot well have
been such an original multiplicity; in fact, recent studies are
tending to consolidate the hundred and fifty New World families
into considerably fewer groups. But the evidence for such reductions
is necessarily difficult to bring and much of it is still
incomplete. The stocks mentioned above have been long determined
and generally accepted.</p>

<p>About a third of humanity to-day speaks some form of Indo-European.
A quarter talks some dialect of Sinitic stock.
Semitic, Dravidian, Ural-Altaic, Japanese, Malayo-Polynesian,
Bantu have each from about fifty to a hundred million speakers.
The languages included in these eight families form the speech
of approximately ninety per cent of living human beings.</p>

<h3 id="section51">51. <span class="smcap">Classification of Languages by Types</span></h3>

<p>A classification is widely prevalent which puts languages
according to their structure into three types: inflective, agglutinating,
and isolating. To this some add a fourth type, the
polysynthetic or incorporating. While the classification is
largely misrepresentative, it enters so abundantly into current
thought about human speech that it is worth presenting, analyzing,
and, so far as it is invalid, refuting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

(Based on Chamberlain.)</p></figcaption>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>An inflecting language expresses relations or grammatical
form by adding prefixes or suffixes which cannot stand alone,
or if they stood alone would mean nothing; or that operates by
internal modifications of the stem, which also can have no independent
existence. The <i>-ing</i> of <i>killing</i> is such an inflection; so
are the vowel changes and the ending <i>-en</i> in the conjugation
<i>write</i>, <i>wrote</i>, <i>written</i>.</p>

<p>An isolating language expresses such relations or forms by
separate words or isolated particles. English <i>heart of man</i> is
isolating, where the Latin equivalent <i>cor hominis</i> is inflective,
the per se meaningless suffix <i>-is</i> rendering the genitive or possessive
force of the English word <i>of</i>.</p>

<p>An agglutinative language glues together into solid words elements
for which a definite meaning of their own can be traced.
English does not use this mechanism for purposes that are ordinarily
reckoned as strictly grammatical, but does employ it for
closely related purposes. <i>Under-take</i>, <i>rest-less</i>, are examples;
and in a form like <i>light-ly</i>, which goes back to <i>light-like</i>, the
force of the suffix which converts the adjective into the adverb
is of a kind that in descriptions of most languages would be
considered grammatical or formal.</p>

<p>Polysynthetic languages are agglutinative ones carried to a
high pitch, or those that can compound words into equivalents
of fair sized sentences. <i>Steam-boat-propeller-blade</i> might be
called a polysynthetic form if we spoke or wrote it in one word
as modern German and ancient Greek would.</p>

<p>Incorporating languages embody the object noun, or the pronoun
representing it, into the word that contains the verb stem.
This construction is totally foreign to English.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Each of these classes evidently defines one or more distinctive
linguistic processes. There are different mechanisms at work in
<i>kill-ing</i>, <i>of man</i>, <i>light-ly</i>. The distinction is therefore both valid
and valuable. Its abuse lies in trying to slap the label of one
type on a whole language. The instances given show that English
employs most of the several distinct processes. Obviously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
it would be arbitrary to classify English as outright of one type.
This is also the situation for most other languages. There are
a few languages that tend prevailingly in one direction or the
other: Sanskrit and Latin and Hebrew toward the inflective
structure, Turkish toward the agglutinative, Chinese toward the
isolating. But they form a small minority, and most of them
contain certain processes of types other than their predominating
ones. Sanskrit, for instance, has polysynthetic traits, Hebrew
incorporating ones. Therefore, so long as these concepts
are used to picture a language in detail, with balanced recognition
of the different processes employed by it, they are valuable
tools to philological description. When on the other hand the
concepts are degraded into catchwords designating three or four
compartments into one of which every language is somehow to
be stuffed, they grossly misrepresent most of the facts. The
concepts, in short, apply usefully to types of linguistic processes,
inadequately to types of languages.</p>

<p>Why then has the classification of human languages into inflecting,
agglutinating, isolating, and polysynthetic or incorporating
ones been repeated so often? First of all, because languages
vary almost infinitely, and a true or natural classification,
other than the genetic one into families, is intricate. The
mind craves simplicity and the three or four supposedly all-embracing
types are a temptation.</p>

<p>A second reason lies deeper. As philology grew up into a
systematic body of knowledge, it centered its first interests on
Latin and Greek, then on Sanskrit and the other older Indo-European
languages. These happened to have inflective processes
unusually well developed. They also happened to be the
languages from which the native speech of the philologists was
derived. What is our own seems good to us; consequently Indo-European
was elevated into the highest or inflective class of languages.
As a sort of after-thought, Semitic, which includes
Hebrew, the language of part of our Scriptures, was included.
Then Chinese, which follows an unusually simple plan of structure
that is the opposite in many ways of the complex structure
of old Indo-European, and which was the speech of a civilized
people, was set apart as a class of the second rank. This left
the majority of human languages to be dumped into a third<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
class, or a third and fourth class, with the pleasing implication
that they were less capable of abstraction, more materialistic,
cruder, and generally inferior. Philologists are customarily
regarded as extreme examples of passionless, dry, objective
human beings. The history of this philological classification
indicates that they too are influenced by emotional and self-complacent
impulses.</p>

<h3 id="section52">52. <span class="smcap">Permanence of Language and Race</span></h3>

<p>It is sometimes thought because a new language is readily
learned, especially in youth, that language is a relatively unstable
factor in human history, less permanent than race. It
is necessary to guard against two fallacies in this connection.
The first is to argue from individuals to societies; the second,
that because change is possible, it takes place.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, languages often preserve their existence,
and even their territory, with surprising tenacity in the face of
conquest, new religions and culture, and the economic disadvantages
of unintelligibility. To-day, Breton, a Keltic dialect,
maintains itself in France as the every-day language of the
people in the isolated province of Brittany—a sort of philological
fossil. It has withstood the influence of two thousand
years of contact, first with Latin, then with Frankish German,
at last with French. Its Welsh sister-tongue flourishes in spite
of the Anglo-Saxon speech of the remainder of Great Britain.
The original inhabitants of Spain were mostly of non-Aryan
stock. Keltic, Roman, and Gothic invasions have successively
swept over them and finally left the language of the country
Romance, but the original speech also survives the vicissitudes
of thousands of years and is still spoken in the western Pyrenees
as Basque. Ancient Egypt was conquered by the Hyksos, the
Assyrian, the Persian, the Macedonian, and the Roman, but
whatever the official speech of the ruling class, the people continued
to speak Egyptian. Finally, the Arab came and brought
with him a new religion, which entailed use of the Arabic language.
Egypt has at last become Arabic-speaking, but until a
century or two ago the Coptic language, the daughter of the
ancient Egyptian tongue of five thousand years ago, was kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
alive by the native Christians along the Nile, and even to-day
it survives in ritual. The boundary between French on the one
side and German, Dutch, and Flemish on the other, has been
accurately known for over six hundred years. With all the wars
and conquests back and forth across the speech line, endless
political changes and cultural influences, this line has scarcely
anywhere shifted more than a few dozen miles, and in places
has not moved by a comfortable afternoon’s stroll.</p>

<p>While populations can learn and unlearn languages, they tend
to do so with reluctance and infinite slowness, especially while
they remain in their inherited territories. Speech tends to be
one of the most persistent ethnic characters.</p>

<p>In general, where two populations mingle, the speech of the
more numerous prevails, even if it be the subject nationality.
A wide gap in culture may overcome the influence of the majority,
yet the speech of a culturally more active and advanced
population ordinarily wrests permanent territory to itself slowly
except where there is an actual crowding out or numerical
swamping of the natives. This explains the numerous survivals
and “islands” of speech: Keltic, Albanian, Basque, Caucasian,
in Europe; Dravidian and Kolarian in India; Nahuatl and
Maya and many others in modern Mexico; Quechua in Peru;
Aymara in Bolivia; Tupi in Brazil. There are cases to the
contrary, like the rapid spread of Latin in most of Gaul after
Cæsar’s conquest, but they seem exceptional.</p>

<p>As to the relative permanence of race and speech, everything
depends on the side from which the question is approached.
From the point of view of hereditary strains, race must be the
more conservative, because it can change rapidly only through
admixture with another race, whereas a language may be completely
exchanged in a short time. From the point of view of
history, however, which regards human actions within given territories,
speech is often more stable. Wars or trade or migration
may bring one racial element after another into an area
until the type has become altered or diluted, and yet the original
language, or one directly descended from it, remains. The introduction
of the negro from Africa to America illustrates this
distinction. From the point of view of biology, the negro has at
least partially preserved his type, although he has taken on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
wholly new language. As a matter of history, the reverse is
true: English continues to be the speech of the southern United
States, whereas the population now consists of two races instead
of one, and the negro element has been altered by the infusion
of white blood. It is a fallacy to think, because one can learn
French or become a Christian and yet is powerless to change
his eye color or head shape, that language and culture are altogether
less stable than race. Speech and culture have an existence
of their own, whose integrity does not depend on hereditary
integrity. The two may move together or separately.</p>

<h3 id="section53">53. <span class="smcap">The Biological and Historical Nature of Language</span></h3>

<p>It is a truism, but one important never to forget in the study
of man, that the faculty of speech is innate, but every language
wholly acquired. Moreover, the environment of which languages
are the product is not a natural one, that is, geographic
or climatic, but social. All words and speech forms that are
learned—and they constitute almost the complete mass of language—are
imitated directly from other human beings. Those
new forms that from time to time come into use rest on existing
speech material, are shaped according to tendencies already
operative although perhaps more or less hidden, cannot generally
be attributed, as regards origin, or at least entire origin,
to single individuals; in short, present a history similar to that
of inventions and new institutions. Language thus is a superorganic
product; which of course does not contradict—in fact
implies—that it rests on an organic basis.</p>

<p>The “speech” of the animals other than man has something
in common with human languages. It consists of sounds produced
by the body, accompanied by certain mental activities or
conditions, and capable of arousing certain definite responses in
other individuals of the species. It differs from human speech
in several fundamental particulars. First of all, the cries and
calls and murmurs of the brutes appear to be wholly instinctive.
A fowl raised alone in an incubator will peep and crow or cluck
as it will scratch and peck. A dog reared by a foster cat will
bark, or growl, or whine, or yelp, when it has attained the
requisite age, and on application of the proper stimulus, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
will wag or crouch or hunt or dig, and no differently from the
dog brought up in association with other dogs. By contrast, the
Japanese infant turned over to American foster parents never
utters or knows a single Japanese word, learns only English, and
learns that as well as do his Caucasian step-brothers. Evidently
then, animal speech is to all intents wholly organic and
not at all “social” in the sense of being superorganic. If this
summary is not absolutely exact, it departs from the truth only
infinitesimally.</p>

<p>Further, animal speech has no “meaning,” does not serve as
a vehicle of “communication.” The opposite is often assumed
popularly, because we anthropomorphize. If it is said that a
dog’s growl “means” anger, and that his bark “communicates”
suspicion or excitement to his fellows, the words are used in a
sense different from their significance when we say that the term
<i>red</i> “means” the color at one end of the spectrum, or that a
message of departure “communicates” information. The animal
sounds convey knowledge only of subjective states. They
“impart” the fact that the utterer feels anger, excitement, fear,
pain, contentment, or some other affect. They are immediate
reflex responses to a feeling. They may be “understood” in the
sense that a sympathetic feeling is evoked or at any rate mobilized;
and thereby they may lead or tend to lead to action by
the hearers. In the same way, any man instinctively “understands”
the moan of a fellow human being. But the moan does
not tell whether the pain is of a second’s or a week’s duration,
due to a blow or to gas in the bowel, to an ulcerated tooth or
to mental anguish. There is no communication of anything
objective, of ideas as distinct from feelings, as when we say <i>red</i>
or <i>break</i> or <i>up</i> or <i>water</i>. Not one of these simple concepts can
be communicated as such by any brute speech.</p>

<p>One consequence is the “arbitrariness” of human speech.
Why should the sound-cluster <i>red</i> denote that particular color
rather than green? Why does the same word often designate
quite distinct ideas in different languages—the approximate
sound group <i>lay</i> meaning “milk” in French; <i>lass</i> “a girl” in
English, “tired” in French, “allow” in German? Such facts
are physiologically arbitrary; just as it is physiologically arbitrary
and organically meaningless that Americans live in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
republic and Britons under a monarchy, or that they turn respectively
to the right and left on the road. Phenomena like
these have other social, cultural, or superorganic phenomena as
their immediate causes or antecedents. In the light of such
antecedents, viewed on the level of history, these phenomena are
intelligible: we know why the United States is a republic, we
can trace the development of words like <i>lay</i> and <i>lass</i>. It is only
from the biological plane that such facts seem insignificant or
arbitrary.</p>

<h3 id="section54">54. <span class="smcap">Problems of the Relation of Language and Culture</span></h3>

<p>This association of language and civilization, or let us say the
linguistic and non-linguistic constituents of culture, brings up
the problem whether it would be possible for one to exist without
the other. Actually, of course, no such case is known.
Speculatively, different conclusions might be reached. It is difficult
to imagine any generalized thinking taking place without
words or symbols derived from words. Religious beliefs and
certain phases of social organization also seem dependent on
speech: caste ranking, marriage regulations, kinship recognition,
law, and the like. On the other hand, it is conceivable that a
considerable series of inventions might be made, and the applied
arts might be developed in a fair measure by imitation, among
a speechless people. Finally there seems no reason why certain
elements of culture, such as music, should not flourish as successfully
in a society without as with language.</p>

<p>For the converse, a cultureless species of animal might conceivably
develop and use a form of true speech. Such communications
as “The river is rising,” “Bite it off,” “What do
you find inside?” would be within the range of thought of such
a species. Why then have even the most intelligent of the
brutes failed to develop a language? Possibly because such a
language would lack a definite survival value for the species, in
the absence of accompanying culture.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, it would seem that language and culture
rest, in a way which is not yet fully understood, on the
same set of faculties, and that these, for some reason that is
still more obscure, developed in the ancestors of man, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
remaining in abeyance in other species. Even the anthropoid
apes seem virtually devoid of the impulse to communicate, in
spite of freely expressing their affective states of mind by voice,
facial gesture, and bodily movement. The most responsive to
man of all species, the dog, learns to accept a considerable stock
of culture in the sense of fitting himself to it: he develops conscience
and manners, for example. Yet, however highly bred,
he does not hand on his accomplishments to his progeny, who
again depend on their human masters for what they acquire.
A group of the best reared dogs left to themselves for a few
years would lose all their politeness and revert to the predomestic
habits of their species. In short, the culture impulse
is lacking in the dog except so far as it is instilled by man; and
in most animals it can notoriously be instilled only to a very
limited degree. In the same way, the impulse toward communication
can be said to be wanting. A dog may understand
a hundred words of command and express in his behavior fifty
shades of emotion; only rarely does he seem to try to communicate
information of objective fact. Very likely we are
attributing to him even in these rare cases the impulse which
we should feel. In the event of a member of the family being
injured or lost, it is certain that a good dog expresses his agitation,
uneasiness, disturbed attachment; but much less certain
is it that he intends to summon help, as we spontaneously
incline to believe because such summoning would be our own
reaction to the situation.</p>

<p>The history and causes of the development in incipient man
of the group of traits that may be called the faculties for speech
and civilization remain one of the darkest areas in the field of
knowledge. It is plain that these faculties lie essentially in the
sphere of what is ordinarily called the mind, rather than in
the body, since men and the apes are far more similar in their
general physiques than they are in the degree of their ability
to use their physiques for non-physiological purposes. Or, if
this antithesis of physical and mental seem unfortunate, it might
be said that the growth of the faculties for speech and culture
was connected more with special developments of the central
nervous system than with those of the remainder of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<h3 id="section55">55. <span class="smcap">Period of the Origin of Language</span></h3>

<p>Is, then, human language as old as culture? It is difficult
to be positive, because words perish like beliefs and institutions,
whereas stone tools endure as direct evidence. On the
whole, however, it would appear that the first rudiments of
what deserves to be called language are about as ancient as the
first culture manifestations, not only because of the theoretically
close association of the two phases, but in the light of circumstantial
testimony, namely the skull interiors of fossil men. In
Piltdown as well as Neandertal man, those brain cortex areas in
which the nervous activities connected with auditory and motor
speech are most centralized in modern man, are fairly well
developed, as shown by casts of the skull interiors, which conform
closely to the brain surface. The general frontal region,
the largest area of the cortex believed to be devoted to associative
functions—in loose parlance, to thought—is also greater
than in any known ape. More than one authority has therefore
felt justified in attributing speech to the ancestors of man that
lived well back in the Pleistocene. The lower jaws of Piltdown
and in a measure of Heidelberg man, it is true, are narrow and
chinless, thus leaving somewhat less free play to the tongue than
living human races enjoy. But this factor is probably of less
importance than the one of mental facultative development.
The parrot is lipless and yet can reproduce the sounds of human
speech. What he lacks is language faculty; and this, it seems,
fossil man already had in some measure.</p>

<h3 id="section56">56. <span class="smcap">Culture, Speech, and Nationality</span></h3>

<p>This point of view raises the question whether one ought to
speak of language and culture or rather of language as a part
of culture. So far as the process of their transmission is concerned,
and the type of mechanism of their development, it is
clear that language and culture are one. For practical purposes
it is generally convenient to keep them distinct. There
is no doubt that two peoples can share in what is substantially
the same culture and yet speak fundamentally different idioms;
for instance, the Finno-Ugric Magyars or Hungarians among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
the adjacent Slavs, Germans, and Latins of central Europe, who
are all Indo-Europeans. The other way around, the northern
Hindus and west Europeans are certainly different culturally,
yet their languages go back to a common origin. In fact it has
become a commonplace that the arguing of connection between
the three factors of race, language, and culture (or nationality),
the making of inferences from one to the other, is logically unsound
(§ <a href="#section33">33</a>). One can no more think correctly in terms of
Aryan heads or a Semitic race, for instance, than of blond linguistic
types, Catholic physiques, or inflecting social institutions.</p>

<p>At the same time, speech and culture tend to form something
of a unit as opposed to race. It is possible for a population to
substitute a wholly new language and type of civilization for
the old ones, as the American negro has done, and yet to remain
relatively unmodified racially, or at least to carry on its former
physical type unchanged in a large proportion of its members.
On the other hand, a change of speech without some change of
culture seems impossible. Certainly wherever Greek, Latin,
Spanish, English, Arabic, Pali, Chinese have penetrated, there
have been established new phases of civilization. In a lower
degree, the same principle probably holds true of every gain of
one language at the expense of another, even when the spreading
idiom is not associated with a great or active culture.</p>

<p>The linkage of speech and culture is further perceptible in
the degree to which they both contribute, in most cases, to the
idea of nationality. What chiefly marks off the French nation
from the Italian, the Dutch from the German, the Swedish from
the Norwegian—their respective customs and ideals, or the language
gap? It would be difficult to say. The cultural differences
tend to crystallize around language differences, and then
in turn are reinforced by language, so that the two factors
interact complexly. Nationality, especially in its modern developments,
includes another factor, that of social or political
segregation, which may in some degree run counter to both
speech and culture. Switzerland with its German, French, and
Italian speaking population, or Belgium, almost equally divided
between Flemings and Walloons, are striking examples. Yet
however successfully Switzerland and Belgium maintain their
national unity, it is clear that this is a composite of subnational<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
elements, each of which possesses a certain cultural as well as
linguistic distinctness. Thus the Walloon speaks a French dialect,
the Fleming a Dutch one; and the point of view, temperament,
historic antecedents, and minor customs of the two groups
are perceptibly different. Similarly, both the history and the
outlook and therefore the culture of the French and German
cantons of Switzerland are definitely distinguishable.</p>

<h3 id="section57">57. <span class="smcap">Relative Worth of Languages</span></h3>

<p>One respect in which languages differ from cultures is that
they cannot, like the latter, be rated as higher and lower. Of
course, even as regards culture, such rating is often a dubious
procedure, meaning little more than that the person making the
comparison assumes his own culture to be the highest and estimates
other cultures low in proportion as they vary. Although
this is a subjective and uncritical procedure, nevertheless certain
objective comparisons are possible. Some cultures surpass
others in their quantitative content: they possess more different
arts, abilities, and items of knowledge. Also, some culture traits
may be considered intrinsically superior to others: metal tools
against stone ones, for instance, since metal is adopted by all
stone culture peoples who can secure it, whereas the reverse is
not true. Further, in most cases a new addition does not wholly
obliterate an older element, this retaining a subsidiary place, or
perhaps serving some more special function than before. In
this way the culture becomes more differentiated. The old art
may even attain a higher degree of perfection than it had previously;
as the finest polish was given to stone implements in
northern Europe after bronze was known. In general, accretion
is the process typical of culture growth. Older elements
come to function in a more limited sphere as new ones are added,
but are not extirpated by them. Oars and sails remain as constituent
parts of the stock of civilization after it has added steam
and motor boats. In the senses then that a culture has a larger
content of elements, that these elements are more differentiated,
and that a greater proportion of these elements are of the kind
that inherently tend to supersede related elements, the culture
may be considered superior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>As regards languages, there are also quantitative differences.
Some contain several times as many words as others. But
vocabulary is largely a cultural matter. A people that uses
more materials, manufactures more objects, possesses knowledge
of a larger array of facts, and makes finer discriminations in
thought, must inevitably have more words. Yet even notable
increases in size of speech content appear not to be accompanied
by appreciable changes in form. A larger vocabulary does not
mean a different type of structure. Grammar seems to be little
influenced by culture status. No clear correspondence has yet
been traceable between type or degree of civilization and type
of language. Neither the presence nor the absence of particular
features of tense, number, case, reduplication, or the like seems
ever to have been of demonstrable advantage toward the attainment
of higher culture. The speech of the former and modern
nations most active in the propagation of culture has been of
quite diverse type. The languages of the Egyptians (Hamitic);
Sumerians; Babylonians and Arabs (Semitic); Hindus and
Greeks (ancient Indo-European); Anglo-Saxons (modern Indo-European);
Chinese; and Mayas, are about as different as exist.
The Sumerian type of civilization was taken over bodily and
successfully by the Semitic Babylonians. The bulk of Japanese
culture is Chinese; yet Japanese speech is built on wholly different
principles.</p>

<p>Then, it is impossible to rate one speech trait or type as inherently
or objectively superior to another on any basis like
that which justifies the placing of a metal culture above a stone
culture. If wealth of grammatical apparatus is a criterion of
superiority, Latin is a higher language than French, and Anglo-Saxon
than English. But if lack of declensions and conjugations
is a virtue, then Chinese surpasses English almost as much
as English surpasses Latin. There is no reason favoring one
of these possible judgments rather than its opposite. <i>Amabo</i>
is no better or worse than <i>I shall love</i> as a means of expressing
the same idea. The one is more compact, the other more plastic.
There are times when compactness is a virtue, occasions when
plasticity has advantages. By the Latin or synthetic standard,
the English expression is loose jointed, lacking in structure; by
the English or analytic standard, the Latin form is over-condensed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
adhering unnecessarily to form. One cannot similarly
balance the merits of a steel and a flint knife, of a medical and
a shamanistic phase of society. The one cuts or cures better
than the other.</p>

<p>So, from the point of view of civilization, language does not
matter. Language will always keep up with whatever pace culture
sets it. If a new object is invented or a new distinction
of thought made, a word is coined or imported or modified in
meaning to express the new concept. If a thousand or ten
thousand new words are required, they are developed. When
it desires to express abstractions like futurity or plurality, any
language is capable of doing so, even if it does not habitually
express them. If a language is unprovided with formal means
for the purpose, such as a grammatical suffix, it falls back on
content and uses a word or circumlocution. If the life of a
people changes and comes to be conducted along lines that render
it frequently important to express an idea like futurity to which
previously little attention has been paid, the appropriate circumlocution
soon becomes standardized, conveniently brief, and
unambiguous. In general, every language is capable of indefinite
modification and expansion and thereby is enabled to meet
cultural demands almost at once. This is shown by the fact
that virtually anything spoken or written can be translated into
almost every other language without serious impairment of substance.
The æsthetic charm of the original may be lost in the
translation; the new forms coined in the receiving language are
likely at first to seem awkward; but the meaning, the business
of speech, gets expressed.</p>

<h3 id="section58">58. <span class="smcap">Size of Vocabulary</span></h3>

<p>The tendency is so instinctive in us to presuppose and therefore
to find qualities of inferiority, poverty, or incompleteness
in the speech of populations of more backward culture than our
own, that a widespread, though unfounded, belief has grown up
that the languages of savages and barbarians are extremely
limited quantitatively—in the range of their vocabulary. Similar
misconceptions are current as to the number of words actually
used by single individuals of civilized communities. It is true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
that no one, not even the most learned and prolific writer, uses
all the words of the English language as they are found in an
unabridged dictionary. All of us understand many words which
we habitually encounter in reading and may even hear frequently
spoken, but of which our utterance faculties for some
reason have not made us master. In short, a language, being
the property and product of a community, possesses more words
than can ever be used by a single individual, the sum total of
whose ideas is necessarily less than that of his group. Added
to this are a certain mental sluggishness, which restricts most of
us to a greater or less degree, and the force of habit. Having
spoken a certain word a number of times, our brain becomes
accustomed to it and we are likely to employ it to the exclusion
of its synonyms or in place of words of related but distinguishable
meaning.</p>

<p>The degree to which all this affects the speech of the normal
man has, however, been greatly exaggerated. Because there are,
all told, including technical terms, a hundred thousand or more
words in our dictionaries, and because Shakespeare in his writings
used 24,000 different words, Milton in his poems 17,000,
and the English Bible contains 7,200, it has been concluded that
the average man, whose range of thought and power of expression
are so much less, must use an enormously smaller vocabulary.
It has been stated that many a peasant goes through life
without using more than 300 or 400 words, that the vocabulary
of Italian grand opera is about 600, and that he is a person above
the average who employs more than 3,000 to 4,000 words. If
such were the case it would be natural that the uncivilized man,
whose life is simpler, and whose knowledge more confined, should
be content with an exceedingly small vocabulary.</p>

<p>But it is certain that the figures just cited are erroneous. If
any one who considers himself an average person will take the
trouble to make a list of his speaking vocabulary, he will quickly
discover that he knows, and on occasion uses, the names of at
least one to two thousand different things. That is, his vocabulary
contains so many concrete nouns. To these must be added
the abstract nouns, the verbs, adjectives, pronouns, and the
other parts of speech, the short and familiar words that are
indispensable to communication in any language. It may thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
be safely estimated that it is an exceptionally ignorant and
stupid person in a civilized country that has not at his command
a vocabulary of several thousand words.</p>

<p>Test counts based on dictionaries show, for people of bookish
tastes, a knowledge of about 30,000 to 35,000 words. Most of
these would perhaps never be spoken by the individuals tested,
would not be at their actual command, but it seems that at least
10,000 would be so controlled. The carefully counted vocabulary
of a five and a half year old American boy comprised 1,528
understandingly used words, besides participles and other inflected
forms. Two boys between two and three years used 642
and 677 different words.</p>

<p>It is therefore likely that statements as to the paucity of the
speech of unlettered peoples are equally exaggerated. He who
professes to declare on the strength of his observation that a
native language consists of only a few hundred terms, displays
chiefly his ignorance. He has either not taken the trouble to
exhaust the vocabulary or has not known how to do so. It is
true that the traveler or settler can usually converse with natives
to the satisfaction of his own needs with two or three hundred
words. Even the missionary can do a great deal with this stock,
if it is properly chosen. But it does not follow that because a
civilized person has not learned more of a language, that there
is no more. On this point the testimony of the student is the
evidence to be considered.</p>

<p>Dictionaries compiled by missionaries or philologists of languages
previously unwritten run to surprising figures. Thus,
the number of words recorded in Klamath, the speech of a culturally
rude American Indian tribe, is 7,000; in Navaho, 11,000;
in Zulu, 17,000; in Dakota, 19,000; in Maya, 20,000; in
Nahuatl, 27,000. It may safely be said that every existing language,
no matter how backward its speakers are in their general
civilization, possesses a vocabulary of at least 5,000 words.</p>

<h3 id="section59">59. <span class="smcap">Quality of Speech Sounds</span></h3>

<p>Another mistaken assumption that is frequently made is that
the speech of non-literary peoples is harsh, its pronunciation
more difficult than ours. This belief is purely subjective. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
one has heard and uttered a language all his life, its sounds come
to one’s mouth with a minimum of effort; but unfamiliar vowels
and consonants are formed awkwardly and inaccurately. No
adult reared in an Anglo-Saxon community finds <i>th</i> difficult.
Nor does a French or German child, whose speech habits are still
plastic, find long difficulty in mastering the particular tongue
control necessary to the production of the <i>th</i> sound. But the
adult Frenchman or German, whose muscular habits have settled
in other lines, tries and tries and falls back on <i>s</i> or <i>t</i>. A
Spaniard, however, would agree with the Anglo-Saxon as to the
ease and “naturalness” of <i>th</i>. Conversely, the “rough” <i>ch</i>
flows spontaneously out of the mouth of a German or Scotchman,
whereas English, French, and Italians have to struggle long to
master it, and are tempted to substitute <i>k</i>. German <i>ö</i> and
French <i>u</i> trouble us, our “short” <i>u</i> is equally resistant to Continental
tongues.</p>

<p>Even a novel position can make a familiar sound strange and
forbidding. Most Anglo-Saxons fail on the first try to say
<i>ngis</i>; many give up and declare it beyond their capacity to learn.
Yet it is only <i>sing</i> pronounced backward. English uses <i>ng</i>
finally and medially in words, not initially. Any English
speaker can quickly acquire its use in the new position if, to
keep from being disconcerted, he follows some such sequence
as <i>sing</i>, <i>singing</i>, <i>stinging</i>, <i>ringing</i>, <i>inging</i>, <i>nging</i>, <i>ngis</i>.</p>

<p>So with surd <i>l</i>—Welsh <i>ll</i>—which is ordinary <i>l</i> minus the
accompaniment of vocal cord vibrations. A little practice
makes possible the throwing on or off of these vibrations, the
“voicing” of speech, for any sound, with as much ease as one
would turn a faucet on or off. Surd <i>l</i> thereupon flows with the
same readiness as sonant <i>l</i>. As a matter of fact we often pronounce
it unconsciously at the end of words like <i>little</i>. When
it comes at the beginning, however, as in the tribal name usually
written <i>Tlingit</i>, Americans tend to substitute something more
habitual, such as <i>kl</i>, which is familiar from <i>clip</i>, <i>clean</i>, <i>clear</i>,
<i>close</i>, <i>clam</i>, and many other words. The simple surd <i>l</i> has even
been repeatedly described quite inappropriately as a “click”;
which is about as far from picturing it with correctness as calling
it a thump or a sigh; all because it comes in an unaccustomed
position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>Combinations of sounds, especially of consonants, are indeed
of variable difficulty for anatomical reasons. Some, like <i>nd</i> and
<i>ts</i> and <i>pf</i>, have their components telescope or join naturally
through being formed in the same part of the mouth. Others,
like <i>kw</i> (<i>qu</i>), have the two elements articulated widely apart,
but for that reason the elements can easily be formed simultaneously.
Still others, like <i>kt</i> and <i>ths</i>, are intrinsically difficult,
because the elements differ in place of production but are
alike in method, and therefore come under the operation of the
generic rule that similar sounds require more effort to join and
yet discriminate than dissimilar ones; for much the same reason
that it is on the whole easier to acquire the pronunciation of a
wholly new type of sound than of one which differs subtly from
one already known. Yet in these matters too, habit rather than
anatomical functioning determines the reaction. German <i>pf</i>
comes hard to adult Anglo-Saxons, English <i>kw</i> and <i>ths</i> to Germans.
So far as degree of accumulation of consonants is concerned,
English is one of the extremest of all languages. Monosyllables
like <i>tract</i>, <i>stripped</i> (<i>stripd</i>), <i>sixths</i> (<i>siksths</i>), must seem
irremediably hard to most speakers of other idioms.</p>

<p>Children’s speech in all languages shows that certain sounds
are, as a rule, learned earlier than others, and are therefore presumably
somewhat easier physiologically. Sounds like <i>p</i> and <i>t</i>
which are formed with the mobile lips and front of the tongue
normally precede back tongue sounds like <i>k</i>. <i>B</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, which are
voiced like vowels, tend to precede voiceless <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>. Stops or
momentary sounds, such as <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>k</i>, generally come earlier
than the fricative continuants <i>f</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>th</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, which require a delicate
adjustment of lip or tongue—close proximity without firm
contact—whereas the stops involve only a making and breaking
of jerky contact. But so slight are the differences of effort or
skill in all these cases, that as a rule only a few months separate
the learning of the easier from that of the more difficult sounds;
and adults no longer feel the differences. The only sound or
class of sounds seriously harder than others seems to be that
denoted by the letter <i>r</i>. Not only do children usually acquire <i>r</i>
late, but among all races there appears to be a certain percentage
of individuals who never learn to form the sound right, but
substitute one approaching <i>g</i> or <i>w</i> or <i>j</i> or <i>l</i>. The reason is that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
<i>r</i> stands alone among speech sounds. It is the only one produced
by blowing the tongue into a few gross vibrations; which
means that this organ must be held in a special condition of
laxness and yet elevated so that the flow of breath may bear
on it. However, even this inherent difficulty has been insufficient
to prevent many languages from changing easier sounds
into <i>r</i>.</p>

<h3 id="section60">60. <span class="smcap">Diffusion and Parallelism in Language and Culture</span></h3>

<p>A phenomenon which language shows more conspicuously
than culture, or which is more readily demonstrated in it, is
parallel or convergent development, the repeated, independent
growth of a trait (§ <a href="#section89">89</a>, <a href="#section100">100</a>).</p>

<p>Thus sex gender is an old part of Indo-European structure.
In English, by the way, it has wholly disappeared, so far as
formal expression goes, from noun, adjective, and demonstrative
and interrogative pronoun. It lingers only in the personal pronoun
of the third person singular—<i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, <i>it</i>. A grammar of
living English that was genuinely practical and unbound by
tradition would never mention gender except in discussing these
three little words. That our grammars specify <i>man</i> as a masculine
and <i>woman</i> as a feminine noun is due merely to the fact
that in Latin the corresponding words <i>vir</i> and <i>femina</i> possess
endings which are recognized as generally masculine and feminine,
and that an associated adjective ends respectively in masculine
<i>-us</i> or feminine <i>-a</i>. These are distinctions of form of
which English possesses no equivalents. The survival of distinction
between <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, and <i>it</i>, while <i>this</i> and <i>the</i> and <i>which</i>
have become alike irrespective of the sex of the person or thing
they denote, is therefore historically significant. It points back
to the past and to surviving Indo-European languages.</p>

<p>Besides, Indo-European, Semitic and Hamitic express sex by
grammatical forms, although like French and Spanish and
Italian, they know only two genders, the neuter being unrepresented.
These three are the only large language stocks in
which sex gender finds expression. Ural-Altaic, Chinese, Japanese,
Dravidian, Malayo-Polynesian, Bantu, and in general the
language families of Asia, Africa, and America do without,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
although a number of languages make other gender classifications,
as of animate and inanimate, personal and impersonal,
superior and inferior, intelligent and unintelligent. Sex gender
however reappears in Hottentot of South Africa, and in the
Chinook and Coast Salish and Pomo languages of the Pacific
coast of North America.</p>

<p>How is this distribution to be accounted for? Indo-European,
Semitic, and Hamitic occupy contiguous territory, in fact surround
the Mediterranean over a tract approximately co-extensive
with the Caucasian area. Could they in the remote past have
influenced one another? That is, could grammatical sex gender
have been invented, so to speak, by one of them, and borrowed
by the others, as we know that cultural inventions are constantly
diffused? Few philologists would grant this as likely: there are
too few authenticated cases of formal elements or concepts
having been disseminated between unrelated languages. Is it
then possible that our three stocks are at bottom related? Sex
gender in that case would be part of their common inheritance.
For Semitic and Hamitic a number of specialists have accepted
a common origin on other grounds. But for Semitic and Indo-European,
philologists, who are professionally exacting, are in
the main quite dubious. Positive evidence seems yet to be
lacking. Still, the territorial continuity of the three speech
groups showing the trait is difficult to accept as mere coincidence.
In a parallel case in the realm of culture history, a
common source would be accepted as highly probable. Even
Hottentot has been considered a remote Semitic-Hamitic offshoot,
largely, it is true, because of the very fact that it expresses
gender. Philologists, accordingly, may consider the case
still open; but it is at least conceivable that the phenomenon
goes back to a single origin in these four Old World
stocks.</p>

<p>Yet no stretch will account for sex gender in the three
American languages as due to contact influence or diffusion, nor
relate these tongues to the Old World ones. Clearly here is a
case of independent origin or parallel “invention.” Chinook
and Coast Salish, indeed, are in contiguity, and one may therefore
have taken up the trait in imitation of the other. But
Pomo lies well to the south and its affiliations run still farther<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
south. Here sex gender is obviously an independent, secondary,
and rather recent growth in the grammar.</p>

<p>In short, it remains doubtful whether sex gender originated
three or four or five or six times among these seven language
stocks; but it evidently originated repeatedly.</p>

<p>Other traits crop out the world over in much the same manner.
A dual, for instance, is found in Indo-European, Malayo-Polynesian,
Eskimo, and a number of other American languages.
The distinction between inclusive and exclusive <i>we</i>—<i>you and I</i>
as opposed to <i>he and I</i>—is made in Malayo-Polynesian, Hottentot,
Iroquois, Uto-Aztecan.</p>

<p>A true nominative case-ending, such as Latin and the other
varieties of Indo-European evince, is an exceedingly specialized
formation; yet is found in the Maidu language of California.
Articles, in regard to which Indo-European varies, Latin for
instance being without, while its Romance daughter tongues
have developed them, recur in Semitic, in Polynesian, and in
several groups of American languages, such as Siouan and
Hokan. The growth in Romance is significant because of its
historicity, and because it was surely not due to imitation of an
unrelated language. That is, French developed its articles independently
and secondarily; a fact that makes it probable that
many languages in other parts of the world, whose history we
do not know, developed theirs in a parallel manner, as a product
of wholly internal causes—“invented” them, in short, although
wholly unconsciously.</p>

<p>A trait found in a large proportion of the American languages
is the so-called incorporation of the object pronoun
(§ <a href="#section51">51</a>). The objective pronoun, or an element representing it,
is prefixed or suffixed to the verb, made a part of it. The process
is familiar enough to us from Indo-European so far as the subject
is concerned: in Latin <i>ama-s</i>, <i>ama-t</i>, <i>ama-nt</i>, the suffixes
express “you, he, they” and pronouns comparable to the English
ones—independent words—are usually omitted. The <i>-s</i> in
<i>he love-s</i> is the sole survival of the process in modern English.
None of the older Indo-European tongues however showed an
inclination to affix similar elements for the objects, although
there are some approaches in a few recent languages of the
family: Spanish <i>diga-me</i>, “tell me,” and <i>mata-le</i>, “kill him,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
for instance. Semitic on the other hand, and Basque, do “incorporate”
objective elements, whereas most Asiatic and some
American languages do not. Many other instances of parallel
or convergent traits could be cited.</p>

<p>This greater frequency of parallel developments in language
than in culture is perhaps in part due to easier demonstrability
in the field of speech. But in the main the higher frequency
seems real. Two reasons for the difference suggest themselves.</p>

<p>First, the number of possibilities is small in language, so far
as structure is concerned. The categories or concepts used for
classifying and for the indication of relations are rigorously
limited, and so are the means of expression. The distinctions
expressed by gender, for instance, may refer to sex, animateness,
personality, worth, shape, position, or possibly one or two other
qualities; but there they end. If a language recognizes gender
at all, it must have gender of one of these few types. Consequently
there is some probability of several unconnected languages
sooner or later happening upon the same type of gender.
Similarly, for the kinds of number, and of case, and so on, that
are denotable. These larger categories, like gender and number
and case, are not numerous. Then, the means of expressing
such relational and classificatory concepts are limited. There is
position or relative order of words; compounding of them;
accretions of elements to stems, namely prefixes, infixes, and
suffixes; reduplication, the repetition of part or the whole of
words; internal changes by shift of vowel or accent within
words; and therewith the types of grammatical means are about
exhausted. The number of possible choices is so small that the
law of accidental probability must cause many languages to hit
upon the same devices.</p>

<p>A second reason for the greater frequency of parallelism in
language is that structural traits appear to resist diffusion by
imitation to a considerable degree. Words are borrowed, sometimes
freely, almost always to some degree, between contiguous
languages; sounds considerably less; grammar least of all. That
is, linguistic content lends itself to diffusion readily, linguistic
form with difficulty.</p>

<p>At bottom, the same holds of culture. Specific elements of
culture or groups of such elements diffuse very widely at times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
and may be said to be always tending to diffuse: the wheel, for
instance, smelting of metals, the crown as a symbol of royalty,
the swastika, Buddhism. The relations of elements among
themselves, on the other hand, change by internal growth rather
than external imitation. Of this sort are the relations of the
classes and members of societies, the fervor with which religion
is felt, the esteem accorded to learning or wealth or tradition,
the inclination toward this or that avenue of subsistence or
economic development. By conquest or peaceful pressure or
penetration one people may shatter the political structure or
social fabric of another, may undermine its conservatism, may
swerve its economic habits. But it is difficult to find cases of
one people adopting such tendencies or schemes of cultural
organization in mere imitation of the example of another, as it
will adopt specific culture content—the wheel or crown or Buddhism,
for instance—from outside, often readily. The result is
that culture relations or forms develop spontaneously or from
within rather than as a result of direct taking over. Also, the
types of culture forms being limited in number, the same type
is frequently evolved independently. Thus monarchical and
democratic societies, feudal or caste-divided ones, priest-ridden
and relatively irreligious ones, expansive and mercantile or self-sufficient
and agricultural nations, evolve over and over again.
On the whole, comparative culture history more often deals
with the specific contents of civilization, perhaps because events
like the spread of an invention can be traced more definitely
and exactly than the rather complex evolutions of say two
feudal systems can be compared. The result is that diffusions
seem to outweigh parallels; as is set forth in several of the

<p>In comparative linguistics, on the other hand, interest inclines
to the side of form rather than content; hence the parallelisms
or convergences are conspicuous. If as much attention
were generally given to words as to grammar, and if they could
be traced in their prehistoric or unrecorded wanderings as reliably
as many culture traits have been, it is probable that diffusion
would loom larger as a principle shaping human speech.
There are words that have traveled almost as far as the objects
they denote: <i>tobacco</i> and <i>maize</i>, for example. And the absorption<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
of words of Latin origin into English was as extensive as
the absorption for over a thousand years of Latin, Christian,
and Mediterranean culture by the English people—went on as
its accompaniment and result.</p>

<h3 id="section61">61. <span class="smcap">Convergent Languages</span></h3>

<p>Parallel development in speech form is not restricted to traits
like sex gender and object incorporation. It may affect whole
languages. Chinese a long time ago became an extremely
analytical or “isolating” language. That is, it lost all affixes
and internal change. Each word became an unalterable unit.
Sentences are built up by putting together these atoms. Grammatical
relations are expressed by the order of words: the subject
precedes the predicate, for instance. Other ideas that in
many languages are treated formally, such as the plural or
person, are expressed by content elements, that is, by other
words: <i>many</i> for the plural, separate pronouns instead of affixes
for person, and so on. The uniformly monosyllabic words of
Chinese accentuate this isolating character, which however does
not depend intrinsically upon the monosyllabism. In the Indo-European
family, as already mentioned, there has been a drift
in the same direction during the last two thousand years. This
drift toward loss of formal mechanisms and toward the expression
of grammar by material elements or their position only, has
been evident in all branches of Indo-European, but has been
most marked in English. The chief remnants of the older inflectional
processes in spoken English of to-day are four verb
endings, <i>-s</i>, <i>-ed</i>, <i>-ing</i>, <i>-en</i>; three noun endings, the possessive
<i>-’s</i> and the plurals <i>-s</i> and <i>-en</i>, the latter rare; the case ending
<i>-m</i> in <i>whom</i>, <i>them</i>; a few vowel changes for plurals, as in <i>man</i>—<i>men</i>,
and <i>goose</i>—<i>geese</i>; and perhaps two hundred vowel changes
in verbs, like <i>sing</i>, <i>sang</i>, <i>sung</i>. Compared with Latin, Sanskrit,
or even primitive Germanic, this brief list represents a survival
of possibly a tenth of the original synthetic inflectional apparatus.
That is, English has gone approximately nine tenths of
the way towards attaining a grammar of the Chinese type. A
third language of independent origin, Polynesian, has traveled
about the same distance in the same direction. Superficially it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
is less like Chinese in that it remains prevailingly polysyllabic,
but more like it in having undergone heavy phonetic attrition.
This then is a clear case of entire languages converging toward
a similar type.</p>

<p>Another instance is found in the remarkable resemblances in
plan of structure of Indo-European, especially in its older
forms, and of the Penutian group of languages in native California.
Common to these two families are an apparatus of
similar cases, including accusative, genitive, locative, ablative,
instrumental; plural by suffix; vowel changes in the verb according
to tense and mode; a passive and several participles and
modal forms expressed by suffixes; pronouns either separate or
expressed by endings fused with the tense-modal suffixes. Thus,
the processes which make English <i>sing</i>, <i>sang</i>, <i>sung</i>, <i>song</i>, or <i>bind</i>,
<i>bound</i>, <i>band</i>, <i>bond</i>, are substantially identical with those which
have produced in Penutian Yokuts such forms as <i>shokud</i>,
pierce, <i>shukid-ji</i>, pierced, <i>shokod</i>, perforation or hole, <i>shikid</i>,
piercer or arrow. In short, most of the traits generally cited
as constituting the Indo-European languages typically inflectional,
reappear in Penutian, and of course independently as
regards their origin and history.</p>

<p>These would appear to be phenomena comparable to the
growth of feudalism in China more than a thousand years earlier
than in Europe, or the appearance of a great centrally governed
empire in Peru similar to the ancient monarchies of the Orient.</p>

<h3 id="section62">62. <span class="smcap">Unconscious Factors in Language and Culture</span></h3>

<p>The unceasing processes of change in language are mainly
unconscious. The results of the change may rise to the recognition
of the speakers; the act of change, and especially its
causes, happen without awareness of those through whose minds
and mouths they take place. This holds of all departments of
language: the phonetics, the structural form, largely even the
meaning of words. When a change has begun to creep in, it
may be observed and be consciously resisted on the ground of
being incorrect or vulgar or foreign. But the underlying motives
of the objectors are apparently as unknown to themselves
as the impulses of the innovators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>If this view seem extreme, it can easily be shown that the
great bulk of any language as it is, apart from any question
of change, is employed unconsciously. An illiterate person will
use such forms as <i>child</i>, <i>child’s</i>, <i>children</i>, <i>children’s</i> with the
same “correctness” as a philologist, yet without being able to
give an explanation of the grammatical ideas of singularity and
plurality, absoluteness and possession, or to lay down rules as
to the manner of expression of these ideas in English. Grammar,
in short, exists before grammarians, whose legitimate business
is to uncover such rules as are already there. It is an
obviously hasty thought that because grammar happens to be
taught in schools, speech can be grammatical only through such
formal teaching. The Sanskrit and Greek and Latin languages
had their declensions and conjugations before Hindu and Greek
and Roman scholars first analyzed and described them. The
languages of primitive peoples frequently abound with complicated
forms and mechanisms which are used consistently and
applied without suspicion of their existence. It is much as the
blood went round in our bodies quite healthily before Harvey’s
discovery of its circulation.</p>

<p>The quality of unconsciousness seems not to be a trait specifically
limited to linguistic causes and processes, but to hold
in principle of culture generally. It is only that the unconsciousness
pervades speech farther. A custom, a belief, an art,
however deep down its springs, sooner or later rises into social
consciousness. It then seems deliberate, planned, willed, and is
construed as arising from conscious motives and developing
through conscious channels. But many social phenomena can
be led back only to non-rational and obscure motives: the wearing
of silk hats, for instance. The whole class of changes in
dress styles spring from unconscious causes. Sleeves and skirts
lengthen or shorten, trousers flare or tighten, and who can say
why? It is perhaps possible to trace a new fashion to Paris
or London, and to a particular stratum of society there. But
what is it that in the winter of a particular year makes every
woman—or man—of a certain social group wear, let us say, a
high collared coat, or a shoe that does not come above the ankle,
and the next year, or the tenth after, the reverse? It is insufficient
to say that this is imitation of a leader of fashion, of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
professional creator of style. Why does the group follow him
and think the innovation attractive and correct? A year earlier
the same innovation would have appeared senseless or extravagant
to the same group. A year after, it appeals as belated and
ridiculous, and every one wonders that style was so tasteless
so short a time ago.</p>

<p>Evidently the æsthetic emotions evoked by fashions are largely
beyond the control of both individuals and groups. It is difficult
to say where the creative and imitative impulses of fashion
come from; which, inasmuch as the impulses obviously reside
somewhere in human minds, means that they spring from the
unconscious portions of the mind. Evidently then our justification
of the dress styles we happen at any time to be following,
our pronouncing them artistic or comfortable or sensible
or what not, is secondary. A low shoe may be more convenient
than a high one, a brown one more practical than a black one.
That that is not the reason which determines the wearing of low
brown shoes when they are customarily worn, is shown by the
fact that at other times high black ones are put on by every one.
The reasons that can be and are given are so changeable and
inconsistent that they evidently are not the real reasons, but the
false secondary reasons that are best distinguished as rationalizations.
Excuses, we should call them with reference to individual
conduct.</p>

<p>What applies to fashion holds also of manners, of morals, and
of many religious observances. Why we defer to women by
rising in their presence and passing through a door behind them;
why we refrain from eating fish with a knife or drinking soup
out of a two handled cup, though drinking it from a single
handled one is legitimate; why we do not marry close kin; why
we remove our hats in the presence of the deity or his emblems
but would feel it impious to pull off our shoes; all the thousands
of prescriptions and taboos of which these are examples, possess
an unconscious motivation.</p>

<p>Such cases are also illustrations of what is known as the
relativity of morals. The Jew sets his hat on to worship, the
Oriental punctiliously slips out of his shoes. Some people
forbid the marriage of the most remote relatives, others encourage
that of first cousins, still others permit the union of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
uncle and niece. It would seem that all social phenomena which
can be brought under this principle of relativity of standard
are unconsciously grounded. This in turn implies the unconscious
causation of the mores, those products of the social environment
in which one is reared and which one accepts as the
ultimate authority of conduct. As mores are those folkways or
customs to which an emotional coloring has become attached, so
that adherence to the custom or departure from it arouses a
feeling respectively of approval or disapproval, it is evident
that the origin of folkways generally is also unconscious, since
there seems no reason why the emotions or ethical affect enveloping
a customary action should incline more than the custom itself
to spring up unconsciously.</p>

<p>It has become recognized that the average man’s convictions
on social matters remote from him are not developed through
examination of evidence and exercise of reason, but are taken
over, by means of what is sometimes denominated the “herd
instinct,” from the society or period in which he happens to
have been born and nurtured. His belief in democracy, in
monotheism, in his right to charge profit and his freedom to
change residence or occupation, have such origin. In many
instances it is easy to render striking proof of the proposition:
as in the problems of high tariff, or the Athanasian creed, or
compulsory vaccination, which are so technical or intricate as
to be impossible of independent solution by evidence and argument
by the majority of men. Time alone would forbid: we
should starve while making the necessary research. And the
difference between the average man’s attitude on such difficult
points and the highly gifted individual’s attitude toward them
or even toward simpler problems, would seem to be one of
degree only.</p>

<p>Even on the material sides of culture, unconscious motivation
plays a part. In the propulsion of ships, oars and sails
fluctuated as the prevalent means down almost to the period of
steam vessels. It would be impossible to say that one method
was logically superior to the other, that it was recognized as
such and then rationally adhered to. The history of warfare
shows similar changes between throwing and thrusting spears,
stabbing and hewing swords, light and heavy armor. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
Greeks and Macedonians in the days of their military superiority
lengthened their lances and held them. It no doubt
seemed for a time that a definite superiority had been proved
for this type of weapon over the shorter, hurled javelin. Then
the Romans, as part of their legionary tactics, reverted to the
javelin and broke the Macedonian phalanx with their pilum.
But the Middle Ages again fell back on the thrusting lance.
The Greeks successfully developed heavy armor, until Athenian
light armed troops overcame Spartan hoplites. The Macedonians
reintroduced heavy armament, which held sway in Europe until
after the prevalence of firearms. But the last few years have
brought the rebirth of the helmet.</p>

<p>These fashions in tools and practical appliances do not alter
as fast as modern dress styles, and part of their causes can
often be recognized. Yet there seems no essential difference, as
regards consciousness, between the fluctuation of fashions in
weapons—or navigation or cooking or travel or house building—and,
let us say, the fluctuation of mode between soft and stiff
hats or high and low shoes. It may be admitted to have been
the open array of the legion that led to the pilum; the bullet
that induced the abandonment of the breast plate, shrapnel
that caused the reintroduction of the helmet. But these initiating
factors were not deliberate as regards the effects that came
in their train; and in their turn they were the effects of more
remote causes. The whole chain of development in such cases is
devious, unforeseen, mainly unforeseeable. At most there is
recognition of what is happening; in general the recognition
seems to become full only after the change in tool or weapon or
industrial process has become completed and is perhaps already
being undermined once more.</p>

<p>Of course purely stylistic alterations—and linguistic innovations—also
possess their causes. When the derby hat or the
pronoun <i>thou</i> becomes obsolete, there is a reason, whether or not
we know it or do not see it clearly.</p>

<p>The common causal element in all these changes may be called
a shift in social values. Perhaps practical chemical experience
has grown, and gunpowder explodes more satisfactorily; or an
economic readjustment has made it possible to equip more soldiers
with guns. The first result is a greater frequency of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
bullet penetrations in battle; the next, the abandonment of the
breast plate. Increasing wealth or schooling or city residence
makes indiscriminate familiarity of manners seem less desirable
than at an earlier period: brusque <i>thou</i> begins to yield to indirect
plural <i>you</i>. Or again, new verbs, all of regular conjugation
like <i>love</i>, <i>loved</i>, are formed in English or imported from
French until their number outweighs that of the ancient irregular
ones like <i>sing</i>, <i>sang</i>. A standardizing tendency is
thereby set going—“analogizing” is the technical term of the
philologist—which begins to turn irregular verbs into regular
ones: <i>dived</i> replaces <i>dove</i>, just as <i>lenger</i> becomes <i>longer</i>, and
<i>toon</i> becomes <i>toes</i>. There is the same sort of causality in one
of these phenomena as in another. The individual or community
that leaves off the breast plate or stiff hat is more likely to be
aware that it is performing the act than the one that leaves off
saying <i>toon</i> or <i>thou</i>. But it does not seem that there is an
essential difference of process. Linguistic and æsthetic changes
are most fully unconscious, social ones next, material and economic
ones perhaps least. But in all cases change or innovation
is due to a shift of values that are broader than the single
phenomenon in question, and that are held to impulsively instead
of reasonably. That is why all social creations—institutions,
beliefs, codes, styles, speech forms—prove on impartial
analysis to be full of inconsistencies and irrationalities. They
have sprung not from weighed or reasoned choices but from
impulsive desires and emotionally colored habits.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion may be summarized as follows. Linguistic
phenomena and processes are on the whole more deeply
unconscious than cultural ones, without however differing in
principle. In both language and culture, content is more
readily imparted and assimilated than form and enters farther
into consciousness. Organization or structure in both cases takes
place according to unconscious patterns, such as grammatical
categories, social standards, political or economic points of
view, religious or intellectual assumptions. These patterns
attain recognition only in a late stage of sophistication, and
even then continue to alter and to be influential without conscious
control. The number of such linguistic and social patterns<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
being limited, they tend to be approximately repeated
without historic connection. Partially similar combinations of
such patterns sometimes recur, producing languages or cultures
of similar type. But established patterns, and still more their
combinations, replace each other with difficulty. Their spread
therefore takes place through the integral substitution of one
language or culture for another, rather than by piecemeal absorption.
This is in contrast to the specific elements of which
language and culture consist—individual words, mechanical devices,
institutional symbols, particular religious ideas or actions,
and the like. These elements absorb and diffuse readily. They
are therefore imitated more often than they are reinvented. But
linguistic and cultural patterns or structures growing up spontaneously
may possess more general resemblance than historic
connection.</p>

<h3 id="section63">63. <span class="smcap">Linguistic and Cultural Standards</span></h3>

<p>It does not follow that because social usages lack a rational
basis, they are therefore unworthy of being followed, or that
standards of conduct need be renounced because they are relative,
that is, unconsciously founded and changing. The natural
inclination of men being to regard their standards of taste,
behavior, and social arrangement as wholly reasonable, perfect,
and fixed, there follows a first inclination to regard these standards
as valueless as soon as their emotionality and variability
have been recognized. But such a tendency is only a negative
reaction against the previous illusion when this has disappointed
by crumbling. The reaction is therefore in a sense a further
result of the illusion. Once the fundamental and automatic
assumption of fixity and inherent value of social patterns has
been given up, and it is recognized that the motive power of
behavior in man as in the other animals is affective and unconscious,
there is nothing in institutions and codes to quarrel with.
They are neither despicable nor glorious; no more deserving
in virtue of their existence to be uprooted and demolished than
to be defended as absolute and eternal. In some form or other,
they are inevitable; and the particular form which they take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
at this time or that place is always tolerably well founded, in
the sense of being adapted with fair success, or having been but
recently well adapted, to the conditions of natural and social
environment of the group which holds the institution, code, or
standard.</p>

<p>That this is a sane attitude is more easily shown in the field
of language than of culture, because, language being primarily
a mechanism or means, whereas in culture ends or purposes tend
more to obtrude, it is easier to view linguistic phenomena dispassionately.
Grammars and dictionaries, for instance, are evidently
the result of self-consciousness arising about speech which
has previously been mainly unconscious. They may be roughly
compared to social formulations like law codes or written constitutions
or philosophic systems or religious dogmas, which are
also representations of usages or beliefs already in existence.
When grammarians stigmatize expressions like <i>ain’t</i> or <i>them
cows</i> or <i>he don’t</i> as “wrong,” they are judging an innovation,
or one of several established conflicting usages, by a standard
of correctness that seems to them absolute and permanent. As
a matter of actuality, the condemned form may or may not succeed
in becoming established. <i>He don’t</i>, for example, might
attain to correctness in time, although <i>ain’t</i> is perhaps less
likely to become legitimized, and <i>them cows</i> to have still smaller
prospect of recognition. That a form departs from the canon
of to-day of course no more proves that it will be accepted in
future than that it will not. What is certain is that if it wins
sufficient usage, it will also win sanction, and will become part
of the standard of its time.</p>

<p>Linguistic instances like these differ little if at all in principle,
in their involved psychology, from the finding of the Supreme
Court that a certain legislative enactment is unconstitutional
and therefore void; or from the decision of a denomination
that dancing or playing golf on Sunday is wicked; or from
the widespread sentiment that breaking an unpopular law like
that on liquor prohibition is morally justifiable. The chief
point of divergence would seem to be that a court is a constituted
body endowed with an authority which is not paralleled
on the linguistic side, at any rate in Anglo-Saxon countries;
although the Latin nations possess Academies whose dicta on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
correctness of speech enjoy a moral authority approximating the
verdicts of a high court.</p>

<p>It is also of interest to remember that the power of nullifying
legislation was not specifically granted the Supreme Court by
the Constitution of the United States, but that the practice
grew up gradually, quite like a speech innovation which becomes
established. Certain elements in the American population look
upon this power as undesirable and therefore take satisfaction
in pointing out its unsanctioned origin. The majority on the
other hand feel that the situation on the whole works out well,
and that a Supreme Court with its present powers is better than
the risk of a Court without power. Still, it remains curiously
illogical that the preservation of the Constitution should take
place partly through the extra-constitutional functioning of a
constitutional body. In principle such a case is similar to that
of grammarians who at the same time lay down a rule and
exceptions to the rule, because the contradictory usages happen
to be actually established.</p>

<p>Codes, dogmas, and grammars are thus normally reflections
rather than causes. Such influence as they have is mainly in
outward crystallization. They produce a superficial appearance
of permanence. In the field of speech, it is easy to recognize
that it is not grammarians that make languages, but languages
that make grammarians. The analogous process evidently holds
for culture. Lawgivers, statesmen, religious leaders, discoverers,
inventors, therefore only seem to shape civilization. The
deep-seated, blind, and intricate forces that shape culture, also
mold the so-called creative leaders of society as essentially as
they mold the mass of humanity. Progress, so far as it can
objectively be considered to be such, is something that makes
itself. We do not make it. Our customary conviction to the
contrary is probably the result of an unconscious desire not to
realize our individual impotence as regards the culture we live
in. Social influence of a sort we do have as individuals. But
it is a personal influence on the fortune and careers of other
individual members of society, and is concerned largely with
aims of personal security, relative dominance, or affection among
ourselves. This obviously is a different thing from the exertion
of influence on the form or content of civilization as such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<h3 id="section64">64. <span class="smcap">Rapidity of Linguistic Change</span></h3>

<p>The rate of change in language is circumscribed by the principles
of linguistic causality that have been discussed, but it
remains an obscure subject in detail. The opinion often held
that unwritten languages necessarily alter faster than written
ones, or that those of savages are less stable than the tongues
of civilized men, is mainly a naïve reflection of our sense of
superiority. It contravenes the principles just referred to and
is not supported by evidence. Occasional stories that a primitive
tribe after a generation or two was found speaking an
almost made-over language are unconscious fabrications due to
preconception and supported by hasty acquaintance, faulty
records, misunderstanding, or perhaps change of inhabitants.
Nahuatl, the language of the Aztecs, has probably changed less
in four hundred years than Spanish; Quechua, that of the
Incas, no more. English has apparently altered more than any
of the three in the same period. Dozens of native tongues, some
of them from wholly rude peoples, were written down in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by Spanish and other
priests, and in most instances the grammars and dictionaries
prove to be usable to-day.</p>

<p>Cultural alteration would appear to work toward speech
change chiefly in certain ways. New things need new names;
new acts mean new thoughts and new ideas require new words.
These may be imported; or they may be made out of elements
already in the language; or old words may undergo a shift of
meaning. In any event, the change is mainly on the side of
vocabulary. The sounds of a language are generally much less
affected; its plan of structure least of all. The introduction of
a new religion or development of a new form of government
among a people need not be accompanied by changes in the
grammar of their speech, and usually are not, as abundant historical
examples prove.</p>

<p>While the causes of grammatical innovation are far from
clear, contact with alien tongues is certainly a factor in some
degree. An isolated off-shoot of a linguistic group is generally
more specialized, and therefore presumably more altered, than
the main body of dialects of the family. The reason is that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
latter, maintaining abundant reciprocal contact, tend to steady
one another, or if they swerve, to do so in the same direction.
The speakers of the branch that is geographically detached,
however, come to know quite different grammars so far as they
learn languages other than their native one, and such knowledge
seems to act as an unconscious stimulus toward the growth of
new forms and uses. It is not that grammatical concepts are
often imitated outright or grammatical elements borrowed. Acquaintance
with a language of different type seems rather to act
as a ferment which sets new processes going.</p>

<p>It is in the nature of the case that direct specific evidence of
changes of this character is hard to secure. But comparison of
related languages or dialects with reference to their location
frequently shows that the dialects which are geographically
situated among strange languages are the most differentiated.
This holds of Abyssinian in the Semitic family, of Brahui in
Dravidian, of Singhalese in the Indic branch of Indo-European,
of Hopi and Tübatulabal in Shoshonean, of Arapaho and
Blackfoot in Algonkin, of Huastec in Mayan.</p>

<p>But it is also likely that languages differ among each other
in their susceptibility to change, and that the same language
differs in successive periods of its history. It is rather to be
anticipated that a language may be in a phase now of rapid
and then of retarded metabolism, so to speak; that at one stage
its tendency may be toward breaking down and absorption, at
another toward a more rigid setting of its forms. Similarly,
there is reason to believe that languages of certain types of
structure are inherently more plastic than others. At any rate,
actual differences in rate of change are known. The Indo-European
languages, for instance, have perhaps without exception
altered more in the three thousand years of historic record
than the Semitic ones. And so in native America, while contemporary
documentary record is of course wanting, the degree
of differentiation within the two stocks suggests strongly that
Athabascan is more tenaciously conservative than Siouan.</p>

<p>There are also notable differences in the readiness to borrow
words ready-made. English is distinctly more hospitable in this
regard than German, which tends rather to express a new concept
by a new formation of old elements. The South American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
languages appear to have borrowed more words from one another
than those of North America. In this matter the type of
language is probably of some influence, yet on the whole cultural
factors perhaps predominate. The direction and degree
of cultural absorption seem to determine the absorption of
words to a considerable measure. Here writing is certainly
potent. The Latin and French element in English, the Sanskrit
and Arabic element in the Malaysian languages, were brought
in to a large extent by writing, and would evidently have remained
much smaller if the historic contacts had been wholly
oral. This is perhaps the most important way in which writing
exerts influence on the development of spoken language; an
influence which in other respects is usually overestimated.</p>

<h3 id="section65">65. <span class="smcap">Fossils of the Body and of the Mind</span></h3>

<p>The discovery of fossils has yielded some idea of the history
of the human body during the past million years. The evidence
is far from complete, but there is enough to prove a development
much as might be expected under the hypothesis of evolution.
To some extent fossils also afford an insight into the
development of the human mind. The capacity of a skull gives
the size of the brain. The interior surface of the skull corresponds
to the outer surface of the brain. In this way some
slight knowledge has been gained of the development in ancient
types of man of the convolutions and centers of the brain surface
with which mental activity is associated. Even limb bones
yield indirect indications. A straight thigh means an erect posture
of the body, with the arms no longer used for locomotion.
Released from this service, they are freed for other purposes,
such as grasping, handling, and various forms of what we call
work. But a hand adapted for work would be useless without
an intelligence to direct its operations. Thus the bones of our
precursors provide suggestions as to the degree of development
of their minds. The suggestions are sketchy and incomplete,
but they are worth something.</p>

<p>A second line of evidence is fuller. When a human or pre-human
hand has made any article, one can judge from that
article what its purpose is likely to have been, how it was used,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
how much intelligence that use involved, what degree of skill
was necessary to manufacture the article. All such artifacts—tools,
weapons, or anything constructed—are a reflection of the
degree of “culture” or civilization, elementary or advanced,
possessed by the beings who made them.</p>

<p>On the whole the evidence to be got from artifacts as to
the degree of advancement of their makers or users is greater
than the information derivable from the structure of skeletons.
A large brain does not always imply high intelligence. Even
a much convoluted brain surface may accompany a mediocre
mind. In other words, the correlation between body and mind
has not been worked out with accuracy. On the other hand an
advanced type of tool necessarily implies more skill in its use,
and therefore a decided development of the use of intelligence.
Similarly, if one finds nothing but simple tools occurring among
any past or present people, we may be sure that their civilization
and the training of their minds have remained backward.</p>

<p>It is true that one cannot always infer from a particular
manufactured object the mentality of the particular person who
owned and used it. An imbecile may come into possession of
a good knife and even possess some ability in using it. But
he can acquire the knife only if there are other individuals
in his community or time who know how to smelt iron and forge
steel. In short, even a single jackknife is proof that human
ingenuity has progressed to the point of making important discoveries,
and that arts of relatively high order are being practised.
In this way a solitary implement, if its discovery is
thoroughly authenticated, may suffice to establish a relatively
high or low degree of civilization for a prehistoric period or a
vanished race.</p>

<p>An implement manufactured by human hands of the past is
of course different from an actual fossil of a former human
being, and it is always necessary to distinguish between the
two. The one is something made by a human being and in
some measure reflecting the development of his intelligence; the
other something left over or preserved from the human body
itself. Nevertheless, in a metaphorical sense, the implements
of the past may well be spoken of as the fossils of civilization.
They are only its fragments, but they allow us to reconstruct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
the mode of life of prehistoric peoples and utterly forgotten
nations, in much the same way as the geologist and the palæontologist
reconstruct from true fossils the forms of life that
existed on the earth or in the seas millions of years ago.</p>

<p>There is even a further parallel. Just as the geologist knows
that one fossil is older or younger than another from its position
in the earth’s crust or the stratum in which it was laid
down, so the student of the beginnings of human civilization
knows that the deposit at the bottom of a cave must be more
ancient than the refuse at the top. He calls in the geologist to
tell him the age of a glacial deposit or of a river terrace, and
thus he may learn that, of two types of implements found at
different places or levels, one is so many thousands of years or
geological periods older than the other. In the long run, too, the
older implements prove to be the simpler. Thus archæologists
have succeeded in working out an evolution of civilization which
parallels rather neatly the evolution of life forms. This evolution
of human mental operations as it is reflected in the artifacts
preserved from the lowest and earliest strata of civilization is
the subject of the present chapter.</p>

<p>There is another way in which the evidence on the two lines
of evolution is similar: its incompleteness. The geological record
has been compared to a book from which whole chapters are
missing; of others, but stray leaves remain; and only now and
then have consecutive pages been preserved unmutilated. Humanity
has always been so much less populous than the remainder
of the animal kingdom, especially in its earlier stages,
that the number of individuals whose bones have been preserved
as fossils is infinitely smaller. The result is that we account
ourselves fortunate in having been able to assemble six or seven
not quite complete skeletons, and fragmentary portions of two
or three dozen other individuals, of the Neandertal race which
inhabited western Europe for thousands of years. For still
earlier races or species of man the actual data are even scantier.
Knowledge of so fundamental a form as Pithecanthropus, the
earliest of the antecedents of man yet known, rests on two bones
and two teeth, plus a third tooth discovered as the sole result
of a subsequent expedition. Heidelberg man has to be reconstructed
from a jaw.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span></p>

<p>The remains which illustrate the development of the human
mind are not so scarce. A single man might easily manufacture
hundreds or even thousands of implements in the course of a
lifetime. When these are of stone they are practically imperishable;
whereas it is only the exceptional skeleton, protected by
favorable circumstances, of which the bones will endure for thousands
of years. For every ancient true fossil trace of man that
has been found, we have therefore thousands of the works of
his hands.</p>

<p>The inadequateness of the cultural record is not in the insufficient
number of the specimens, but in their onesidedness.
Objects of stone, even those of horn and of metal, last; clothing,
fabrics, skins, basketry, and wooden articles ordinarily decay
so rapidly as to have no chance of being preserved for tens of
thousands of years. Tools of the most ancient times have often
been found in abundance; objects manufactured with tools from
softer and less enduring materials are scarce even from moderately
old periods. Now and then a piece of an earthenware
pot may show the imprint of a textile. Textiles and foodstuffs
are occasionally preserved by charring in fire or by penetration
of metallic salts. Charcoal or ashes found in pockets or beds
indicate that fire was maintained in one spot for considerable
periods, and must therefore have been controlled and used, possibly
even produced, by human agency. A bone needle with an
eye proves that some one must have sewn, and one may therefore
assume that garments were worn at the time. But for
every point established in this way there are dozens about which
knowledge remains blank.</p>

<p>Understanding of the social and religious life of the earliest
men is naturally filled with the greatest gaps, and the farther
back one goes in time, the greater is the enveloping darkness.
The problem is as difficult as that of figuring accurately the
degree of intelligence attained by the mailed fishes of the
Devonian age some thirty or forty million years ago, or of estimating
whether the complexion of Pithecanthropus was black,
brown, or white. One can guess on these matters. One may
by careful comparisons obtain some partial and indirect indication
of an answer. But it is clearly wisest not to try to stretch
too far the conclusions which can be drawn. Imagination has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
its value in science as in art and other aspects of life, yet when
it becomes disproportionate to the facts, it is a danger instead
of an aid.</p>

<p>Still, now and then something has been preserved from which
one may draw inferences with a reasonable prospect of certainty
even concerning the non-material side of life. If human
bones are discovered charred and split open, there is good reason
for believing these bones to be the remains of a cannibal feast.
When prehistoric skeletons are found in the position in which
death might have taken place, the presumption is that the people
of that time abandoned their dead as animals would. If on
the other hand a skeleton lies intact with its arms carefully
folded, there is little room for doubt that the men of the time
had progressed to the point where the survivors put away their
dead; in other words, that human burial had been instituted,
and that accordingly at least some rude form of society was in
existence. When, perhaps from a still later period, a skeleton
is found with red paint adhering to the bones, although these
lie in their natural places, the only conclusion to be drawn is
that the dead body was coated with pigment before being interred
and that as the soft tissues wasted away the red ocher
came to adhere to the bones. In this case the painting was evidently
part of a rite performed over the dead.</p>

<h3 id="section66">66. <span class="smcap">Stone and Metals</span></h3>

<p>The cultural record of man’s existence is divided into two
great periods. In the latter of these, in which we are still
living, metals were used; in the earlier, metals were unknown
and tools made of stone. Hence the terms “Age of Stone” and
“Age of Metals.” The duration of these two main periods is
unequal. Metals were first used in Asia and Egypt about 4,000
B.C. and in Europe about 3,000 B.C.—say five to six thousand
years ago. The most conservative authorities, however, would
allow forty or fifty thousand years for the Stone Age; while
others make it cover a quarter million. The assumption, which
is here followed, of the intermediate figure of a hundred thousand
years gives the Stone Age a duration twenty times as
long as the Age of Metals. When one remembers that hand in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
hand with metals came the art of writing and an infinite variety
of inventions, it is clear that larger additions have been made to
human civilization in the comparatively brief period of metals
than in the tremendously longer time that preceded it. Progress
in the Stone Age was not only slow, but the farther back one
peers into this age, the more lagging does the evolution of
human culture seem to have been. One can definitely recognize
a tendency toward the acceleration of evolution: the farther
advancement has got the faster it moves.</p>

<p>The Age of Metals is subdivided into the Iron Age, which
begins some three thousand years ago, say about 1,500-1,000
B.C.; and an earlier Bronze Age. In the Bronze Age one must
distinguish first a period in which native copper was employed
in some parts of the world; after which comes an era in which
it had been learned that copper melted with a proportion of
about one-tenth tin, thus producing bronze, was a superior material.
Within the past five thousand years or so, accordingly,
there are recognized successively the ages of copper, of bronze,
and of iron.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, these five thousand years are also the historic
period. Not that there exist historic records going back
so far as this for every people. But the earliest preserved
documents that the historian uses, the written monuments of
Egypt and Babylonia, are about five thousand years old. The
Age of Metals thus corresponds approximately with the period
of History; the Stone Age, with Prehistory.</p>

<h3 id="section67">67. <span class="smcap">The Old and the New Stone Ages</span></h3>

<p>The Stone Age, apart from a rather doubtful introductory
era to be mentioned presently, is customarily divided into two
periods, the Old Stone Age and the New Stone Age,—the
Palæolithic and the Neolithic. These words of Greek origin
mean literally “old stone” and “new stone” periods. The
criterion by which these two grand divisions were originally
distinguished was that in the Palæolithic artifacts were made
only by chipping, that is, some process of fracturing stone,
whereas Neolithic stone objects were thought to have been
pecked, ground, rubbed, and polished. Indeed the two periods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
have sometimes been designated as the epochs of rough stone
and polished stone implements.</p>

<p>This distinction is now known to be inaccurate. It is true
that the Old Stone Age did not yet employ frictional processes
in shaping stone and confined itself to the older methods of fracturing
by blows or pressure. But the converse is not true, that
the Neolithic worked stone only by grinding, nor even that
grinding was its characteristic process. Stone grinding was
invented only toward the middle of the New Stone Age—in
what is perhaps best designated the “Full Neolithic.” The
Early Neolithic, which lasted half the total Neolithic duration,
continued to work stone by fracture. What marked the beginning
of the Neolithic was certain inventions having nothing to
do with stone: notably pottery and the bow. With these available,
human life took on a new color, and it was not until some
thousands of years later that shaping of stone by grinding came
into use. In other words, the prehistorians’ idea as to what
constitutes the Neolithic have changed, and they no longer put
stone processes in the first place in characterizing the period.
They would do well, therefore, to change its name also to one
having reference to its more specific traits. Such a change of
designation will perhaps become established in time. But at
present the term Neolithic is so intrenched in usage, that to
replace it by “Pottery Age” or “Bow Age” would be misleading:
all the literature on the subject employs “Neolithic.”
The present chapter being concerned specifically with the Palæolithic,
and this being an age in which stone implements did loom
large and were consistently made by fracture only, the difficulties
about the concept of the Neolithic, and its subdivision into
an Early and a Full period, can be reserved for discussion later
(Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">XIV</a>). But it is well to bear in mind as the Palæolithic
is examined in the pages immediately following, that the
Neolithic is neither its antithesis nor its logical complement, but
rather a period signalized by the appearance of totally new
directions of human culture.</p>

<p>Another point in connection with the two processes of working
stone has reference to the mental activities involved by them.
A tolerable ground ax or mortar can be made without much
difficulty by any one willing to take the trouble. A civilized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
person entirely inexperienced in the working of stone would be
likely to produce a fairly satisfactory implement by the rubbing
technique. If however he attempted to manufacture a chipped
stone tool, even of simple type, he would probably fail repeatedly
before learning to control the method well enough to turn
out an implement without first ruining a dozen. In short, the
manual dexterity required to produce the best forms of chipped
stone tools is greater than that needed for ground ones. Inasmuch
as the chipping process is, however, the earlier, we are
confronted here with a paradox.</p>

<p>Yet the paradox is only on the surface. It is true that so
far as skill alone is concerned a good chipped tool is more
difficult to make than a ground one. But it can be made in a
shorter time. A rough stone tool can be manufactured in a
few minutes. A good artifact may be preceded by a number
of unsuccessful attempts or “rejects,” and yet be produced in
an hour or less. The processes of pecking, grinding, and polishing,
on the other hand, are laborious. They are slow even
when pursued with steel tools, and when the shaping material
is no better than another stone or sand, as was of course always
the case in prehistoric times, the duration of the labor must
have been discouraging. Weeks or at least days would be required
to manufacture a single implement. If the work was
done at odd times, one may imagine that many a stone ax was
months in being produced. Patience and forethought of a rather
high order are thus involved in the making of implements of
the Neolithic type. Dexterity is replaced by higher qualities
of what might be called the moral order. By comparison, the
earliest men lacked these traits. They would not sit down
to-day to commence something that would not be available for
use until a month later. What they wanted they wanted
quickly. To think ahead, to sacrifice present convenience to
future advantage, must have been foreign to their way of life.
Therefore they chipped; and although in the lapse of thousands
of years they learned to do some chipping of high quality, they
continued to operate with modifications of the same rough and
rapid process. The uses to which their implements could be
put were also correspondingly restricted. A first-class ax, a
real chisel, or a mortar in which grinding can be done, can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
scarcely be made by chipping alone. It was not until men had
learned to restrain their childish impulse to work only for the
immediate purpose, and had acquired an increased self-control
and discipline, that the grinding of stone came into use.</p>

<p>One principle must be clearly adhered to in the dating or
proper arrangement of the periods of prehistoric time: the principle
that it is always the highest types of implements which
determine the age of a deposit. Lower forms often persist from
the earlier periods into the later, alongside the newly invented
higher types. The men of the Full Neolithic time did not wholly
give up making chipped implements because they also ground
stone. Just so we have not discarded the use of stone because
we use metals, and we still employ copper for a great variety
of purposes although we live in an age of which iron and steel
are characteristic. To reckon a people as Palæolithic because
they had chipped implements as well as ground ones, would be
as misleading as to assert that we still belong to the Stone Age
because we build houses of granite. In fact, stone masonry has
had its principal development since metals have been in use.</p>

<p>This caution seems elementary enough. But it has sometimes
been overlooked by scholars in the pursuit of a theory that made
them try to stamp some prehistoric or savage race as particularly
primitive. If in a stratum of ancient remains there are
discovered a thousand chipped artifacts and only ten that are
ground or polished but the latter unquestionably left there at
the same time as the thousand chipped ones, one is justified in
reckoning the whole deposit as Full Neolithic in period. For in
such a case it is clear that the art of grinding must have been
already known, even though it may as yet have been practised
only occasionally.</p>

<p>It is found that all surviving peoples of primitive culture—American
Indians, Australian black-fellows, Polynesians, Hottentots,
and the like—except probably the Tasmanians, have
attained the grinding stage of development. It is true enough
that many American Indian tribes chipped arrow-points and
knives more frequently than they would grind out axes. Yet
without exception they also knew the process of grinding stone
and applied it to some purpose. For this reason the endeavors
that have been made by certain authors, who compare particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
modern savage peoples to the races of prehistoric Europe on the
basis of a similarity of their chipped implements, are misleading.
It is true that tools like those produced in the Mousterian
period of the Old Stone Age are made by the modern Australian
tribes, and that certain Magdalenian implements from near the
end of the Old Stone Age find parallels among those of the
Eskimo. But both the Australians and the Eskimo practise the
art of rubbing and polishing of stone, which was unknown in
the Palæolithic. They therefore belong clearly to a later stage
of civilization. Too great an insistence on such parallels would
be likely to give rise to the implication that the Australians were
a species of belated Mousterian Stone Age men, and the Eskimo
only Magdalenians whom the Arctic regions had somehow perpetuated
for ten thousand years; whereas their civilizations consist
of Mousterian and Magdalenian ingredients plus many subsequent
elements. The stage of development of the art of chipping
in stone may be the same; the other arts and customs of
modern Australian black-fellows and of Eskimos, and their
bodily types, differ from those of the prehistoric Europeans.</p>

<p>With the distinction of the Palæolithic, Neolithic, and the
Ages of Copper, Bronze, and Iron in mind, it is in order to
examine what may have preceded them, and then to trace in
outline the development which human culture underwent during
the Palæolithic in the continent in which its records are best
explored—Europe.</p>

<h3 id="section68">68. <span class="smcap">The Eolithic Age</span></h3>

<p>The earliest of all periods of human handiwork, although a
somewhat doubtful one, is the Eolithic, or age of the “dawn
of stone” implements.</p>

<p>On purely theoretical grounds it appears likely, indeed almost
inevitable, that the first definitely chipped implements did not
develop full-fledged, but were preceded by still cruder tools,
made perhaps without clear intent, and at any rate so rough and
half-shaped that they would be difficult to recognize.</p>

<p>After the evolution of Palæolithic implements had become
pretty well known, this conjecture began to be supported by
evidence, or at least by alleged evidence. Investigators, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
Rutot in Belgium, found flints of which it was difficult
to say whether or not they had been used by human hands.
These pieces occurred in extremely ancient deposits. On the
basis of these discoveries Rutot and his followers established
the Eolithic period. Some have consistently assailed this
Eolithic age as imaginary, asserting that the so-called eoliths
were nothing but accidental products of nature. Others have
accepted the eoliths and recognize the stage of embryonic or
pre-human civilization which they imply. Still other students
remain in doubt; and their attitude is perhaps still the safest
to share.</p>

<p>The view now most prevalent is that the alleged Eolithic
flints may have been used by early human hands, but that they
were almost certainly not manufactured. This would make them
tools only in the sense in which the limb of a tree is a tool
when a man in distress seizes it to defend himself.</p>

<p>The eoliths are more or less irregular pieces of flint or similar
stone, some of them so blunt that they must have been very
inefficient if used for chopping or cutting or scraping. Small
nocks or chips along the edge are believed not to have been
flaked off with the conscious intent of producing an edge, but
to have become chipped away through usage while the stone was
being manipulated as a naturally formed tool. This would be
much in line with our picking up a cobblestone in default of
an ax or hammer, and continuing to maul away with it until
the rough handling broke off several pieces and happened accidentally
to produce an edge. That the eoliths were such unintentionally
made tools is the most that can safely be claimed
for them.</p>

<p>Even so some doubts remain. Stones similar to eoliths in every
respect, except that their fractures show a fresher appearance,
have been taken by dozens out of modern steel drums in which
flint-bearing chalk was being broken for industrial purposes.</p>

<p>Then, too, the first believers in the authenticity of the eoliths
reported them as occurring from the middle and earlier layers
of the Pleistocene, in which periods we know that nearly human
or half-human types like Heidelberg man and Pithecanthropus
were already in existence. These two species being more similar
to modern man than to the apes or other animals, we must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
imagine them to have been gifted with at least some human
intelligence. It would therefore have been entirely possible for
them to supplement the tools with which nature endowed them—their
hands and teeth—with flints which they picked up and
manipulated in one useful way or another without particularly
troubling to shape the stones.</p>

<p>So far the argument is all in favor of the reality of the eolith.
Before long, however, it was discovered that eoliths were not
especially more abundant in the middle Pleistocene just previous
to the opening of the Palæolithic, when we should expect them
to have been most numerous, than they were in the early
Pleistocene, when the human species must still have been most
rudimentary. Then it was found that eoliths occur in lower
strata than the earliest Pleistocene, namely, in the Pliocene, in
the Miocene, and perhaps even earlier, in the Oligocene. Yet
these periods are divisions of the Tertiary, or Age of Mammals—the
age before man had been evolved! In short, the argument
cuts too far. Once one begins to accept eoliths it is difficult to
stop accepting them without carrying them back into a period
of geological history when evolution could scarcely have produced
a form sufficiently advanced in intelligence to use them.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps on the whole the strongest argument in favor of the
authenticity of the Pleistocene eoliths is the fact that the first
implements known positively to belong to the Old Stone Age
are just a little too well shaped and efficient to represent the
products of the very beginnings of human manual dexterity.
One cannot help but look for something antecedent that was
simpler and ruder; and this need of the imagination the eoliths
do go a long way to satisfy.</p>

<h3 id="section69">69. <span class="smcap">The Palæolithic Age: Duration, Climate, Animals</span></h3>

<p>With the Eolithic period passed and the Palæolithic entered,
our history of incipient human culture is on a solid foundation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
especially so far as western Europe, the best explored region,
is concerned. The general relation of this Old Stone Age in
geological time may be defined as follows. The Quaternary,
whose duration may be estimated to have been about a million
years, is subdivided into the Pleistocene and the Recent. Of
the two, the Recent is very much shorter than the Pleistocene.
Broadly speaking, from ninety-eight to ninety-nine per cent of
the total duration of the Quaternary was occupied by the
Pleistocene. The small remainder which the geologist calls
“Recent,” corresponds to those periods which the archæologist
and the historian name the New Stone and Metal Ages; say
the past ten thousand years. The Old Stone Age therefore
falls in the Pleistocene. But it occupies only the later duration
of the Pleistocene; the earlier part of the Pleistocene is
barren of tools or other records of human culture, except so
far as the eoliths may be so considered.</p>

<p>The proportion of the Pleistocene which is covered by the
Old Stone Age is variously estimated. Some geologists will not
allow the undisputed Palæolithic to have extended over more
than the last tenth of the Pleistocene: the rivers have not
changed their beds enough to permit the assumption of a longer
period. This allowance would give the Palæolithic a duration of
perhaps a hundred thousand years, which is the figure here followed.
Those who place the beginning of the European Palæolithic
in the second instead of the third interglacial period,
would have to admit a considerably longer duration.</p>

<p>The geologist, because he deals with such enormous durations,
has to operate on a broad-gauge scale, and usually disdains to
commit himself to close estimates of years. To measure the lapse
of time within the Pleistocene, he has found it most useful to
avail himself of the evidences left by the great glaciers which
repeatedly covered parts of several continents during the Pleistocene,
and he has therefore given this period its popular name
of “glacial epoch.” These glaciations must be imagined as
having occurred on a much larger scale than one might at first
infer from the shrunken remnants of the glaciers that persist
in the Alps and other mountains. The Pleistocene glaciers were
vast sheets, hundreds of feet in thickness, sliding uniformly
over valleys, hills, and mountains except for an occasional high<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
peak. Modern Greenland, which except at the edges is buried
under a solid ice cap, evidently presents a pretty fair picture
of what the northern parts of Europe and North America repeatedly
looked like during the Pleistocene.</p>

<p>Four such glaciations, or periods of maximum extent of the
continental ice, have been distinguished, and more or less correlated,
in Europe and North America. In Europe they have
been designated as the Günz, Mindel, Riss, and Würm glaciations
respectively (<a href="#figure05">Fig. 5</a>). Each of these is the name of a
locality in the Alps at which typical moraines or erosions produced
by the ice of that period have been carefully observed.</p>

<p>Between these four successive advances of the ice sheets there
fell more temperate eras, some of them rather arid, and others
moist and almost tropical even in the latitude of Europe. These
mild intervals are known as the interglacial periods. That Europe
was free from ice during these interglacial periods is shown
not only by facts of a purely geological nature but by the occurrence
in these periods of fossils of a semi-tropical fauna which
included elephants, rhinoceroses, lions, and the like.</p>

<p>Coming now to a consideration of the relation of man to these
ice eras, we find that the first, second, and probably the third
glaciations passed without leaving sure evidence of manufactured
stone implements. In the last interglacial period, that
which falls between the Riss and the Würm glaciations, the
so-called “Chellean picks” appear; and from then on the record
of artifacts is a continuous one. Considerable parts of Europe
remained habitable all through the fourth and last glaciation,
the Würm period, as the implements discovered prove. Gradually,
although irregularly and with three minor advances and recessions,
always diminishing in rigor, however, this last predominance
of the ice died away; until, by the time its effects had
wholly disappeared, and the geologically “Recent” era was inaugurated,
human civilization had evolved to a point where it
began to enter the New Stone Age.</p>

<p>The animals whose fossils are found in the same deposits with
human skeletons and artifacts have been of the greatest assistance
in the determination of the periods of such remains. The
fossils are partly of extinct species until toward the very end
of the Pleistocene, when exclusively living types of animals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
begin wholly to supersede the earlier ones. While the identification
of the various species, and the fixation of the age of each,
is the work of the specialist in palæontology, the results of such
studies are all-important to the historian of man’s beginnings,
because they help to determine chronology. If artifacts are
found in association with fossil remains of an extinct animal
such as the mammoth or the woolly rhinoceros, they are obviously
older than artifacts that are accompanied only by the
bones of the reindeer, the dog, or other living species. For this
reason, although the history of mammalian life in the past is a
science in itself, it also has close relations with human prehistory.
Some of the most characteristic animals of the later
Pleistocene, and the successive stages of human cultural development
with which they were associated, are listed on the following
page.</p>

<h3 id="section70">70. <span class="smcap">Subdivisions of the Palæolithic</span></h3>

<p>The places at which the men of the Stone Age lived and where
their debris accumulated are known as “stations.” The word
was first employed in this sense in French, but has been taken
over into other languages. A “station” then is simply a spot
at which prehistoric remains of human occupation are found.
At least a thousand of these have been discovered in western
Europe. In general they divide into two classes. One kind is
in the open, mostly in the gravels laid down by streams. These
are therefore known as “River Drift” or simply “Drift” stations.
The other kind is found in caves or under sheltering
rocks. The majority of Drift stations have proved to be from
the earlier or Lower Palæolithic, whereas the Cave stations date
mostly from the later or Upper Palæolithic. The Drift and the
Cave periods are therefore often distinguished within the Old
Stone Age, especially by English archæologists. French, German,
and American students generally use the terms “Lower
Palæolithic” and “Upper Palæolithic,” whose reference is to
periods of cultural development rather than type of locality
inhabited, and which carry more significance. French archæologists
also speak of the Upper Palæolithic as the Reindeer Age.</p>

<p>The student who perhaps contributed most to the foundation
of knowledge of the Palæolithic period was Gabriel de Mortillet.
He first recognized four distinct sub-periods of the Palæolithic,
each possessing its distinctive kinds of implements. These four
periods, each named after one particular “station,” are the
Chellean or earliest; the Mousterian; the Solutrean; and the
Magdalenian or latest. These derived their designations from
the four stations of Chelles in northern France, and of Le
Moustier, Solutré, and La Madeleine in southern France (<a href="#figure16">Fig.
16</a>). De Mortillet did not endeavor to relate the culture of
each of these four periods wholly to the particular locality for
which he named it. He chose the stations as typical and included
others as belonging to the same eras.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span> Type stations of the Palæolithic periods. (After Osborn.)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As more implements were found and studied, it was recognized,
in part by de Mortillet himself, that while his original
classification was sound, it was also incomplete. Two other
periods had to be admitted. One of these, the Acheulean, falls
before the Mousterian, and the second, the Aurignacian, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
it. This makes six periods within the Old Stone Age; and these
have been adopted by all students of the prehistory of man in
Europe. The first three, the Chellean, Acheulean, and Mousterian,
make up the Lower Palæolithic; the last three, the
Aurignacian, Solutrean, and Magdalenian, constitute the Upper
Palæolithic or Reindeer Age. These six divisions of the Old
Stone Age are so essential to an understanding of the prehistory
of man, that the serious student finds it necessary to know their
names and sequence automatically.</p>

<h3 id="section71">71. <span class="smcap">Human Racial Types in the Palæolithic</span></h3>

<p>When it comes to defining the types of fossil man in the
Palæolithic, a curious situation develops. Long before there
was even a true Stone Age, in the early and middle Pleistocene,
there lived the half-human Pithecanthropus and the primitively
human Heidelberg race (§ <a href="#section11">11</a>, <a href="#section12">12</a>). But for the whole first part
of the Palæolithic, throughout the Chellean and Acheulean, no
undisputed find of any skeletal remains has yet been made, although
thousands of implements have been discovered which
are undoubtedly human products.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>In the present state of knowledge the strongest case is that
for the skull found at Piltdown in southern England. This is
said to have been associated with “Pre-Chellean” tools, which
would seem to establish the Piltdown type as the race that lived
about the beginning of the Palæolithic (§ <a href="#section13">13</a>). But the deposit
at Piltdown had been more or less rolled or shifted by natural
agencies before its discovery, so that its age is not so certain as
it might be; and there is no unanimity of opinion as to whether
the highly developed skull and the excessively ape-like jaw that
were found in the deposit really belong together. With this
doubt about the fossil itself, it seems most reasonable not to
press too strongly its identification as the type of man that
lived in Europe at the commencement of the Old Stone Age.</p>

<p>For the end of the Lower Palæolithic, in the Mousterian, conditions
change, and skeletal remains become authentic and comparatively
numerous. From this period date the skeletons of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
the Neandertal species of man: a short, thickset race, powerful
in bones and musculature, slightly stooping at the knee and at
the shoulder, with a thick neck and a large head (§ <a href="#section14">14</a>). The
brain was about as large as that of modern man, but the retreating
aspect of the forehead was accentuated by heavy brow
ridges.</p>

<p>In the Upper Palæolithic the Neandertal species has disappeared.
The first precursors of Homo sapiens, or modern man,
have come on the scene. A sort of transition from Neandertal
man may be presented by the Brünn type, but the prevailing
race in western Europe during the Upper Palæolithic period
is that of Cro-Magnon, a tall, lithe, well-formed people, as agile
and swift as Neandertal man was stocky and strong. The head
and features were well proportioned, the skull and brain remarkably
large, the general type not inferior to modern man,
and probably already proto-Caucasian (§ <a href="#section16">16</a>).</p>

<p>Grimaldi man, so far known only from one spot on the Mediterranean
shore of Europe, was proto-Negroid, Aurignacian in
period, and therefore partly contemporaneous with the Cro-Magnon
race (§ <a href="#section18">18</a>).</p>

<p>In summary, the types of man in Europe during the Old
Stone Age have been as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Magdalenian</td>
    <td>Cro-Magnon</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Solutrean</td>
    <td>Cro-Magnon; Brünn</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Aurignacian</td>
    <td>Cro-Magnon (Caucasian); also, locally Grimaldi (Negroid)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mousterian</td>
    <td>Neandertal (possibly without living descendants)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Acheulean</td>
    <td>Unknown</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chellean</td>
    <td>Unknown; Piltdown perhaps Pre-Chellean</td>

<h3 id="section72">72. <span class="smcap">Palæolithic Flint Implements</span></h3>

<p>The most important line of evidence as to the gradual development
of civilization through the six periods of the Old Stone
Age is the series of flint tools. Hundreds of thousands of these
tools have been discovered in western, central, and southern
Europe—perhaps millions. At St. Acheul were found 20,000
Chellean coups-de-poing; at Solutré, below the Solutrean layer,
35,000 Mousterian-Aurignacian worked flints besides the remains
of 100,000 horses; at Grimaldi in Italy, in the Grotte du Prince,
20,000 Mousterian pieces; at Schweizersbild in Switzerland,
14,000 late Magdalenian implements, and at Kesslerloch, near
by, 30,000 from the late Solutrean and Magdalenian; at
Hundsteig in Austria, 20,000 Aurignacian flints; at Predmost
in Czecho-Slovakia, 25,000 probably of Solutrean age. Stations
of such richness are not particularly rare, and the stations are
numerous. In France alone 500 Magdalenian stations have been
determined.</p>

<p>Clear stratigraphic relations have also been observed again
and again. A few examples are:</p>

</div>

<p>At first inspection Palæolithic relics seem scarcely distinguishable.
They are all of flint, chert, or similar stone; are all
chipped and therefore more or less rough, and consist of forms
meant for cutting, scraping, and piercing. But a closer examination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
reveals differences in their shapes and fundamental differences
in the method of their manufacture. The technique
employed in the fashioning of artifacts is more significant than
their appearance, and it is by directing attention to the process
that one can classify these “fossils of civilization” with accuracy.</p>

<p><i>Chellean.</i>—In the Chellean period there was made substantially
one type of implement, a sort of rude pick, almond or
wedge shaped. It is often somewhat pointed, although rarely
very sharp. The butt end may be rounded, some of the original
surface of the cobble or nodule of flint being left for convenience
of the hand in grasping the implement (<a href="#figure18">Fig. 18</a>, <i>a</i>).
This tool is known as the “Chellean pick.” The Germans often
call it <i>faust-keil</i> or “fist wedge” and the French have coined
the expressive epithet <i>coup-de-poing</i> or “blow of the fist.” The
Chellean pick averages from four to six inches in length, somewhat
less in breadth, and weighs perhaps from a quarter to a
full pound. It would have made an effective rude weapon.
When firmly grasped and well directed, it could easily crush a
skull. It might serve to split wood, hack limbs from trees,
butcher large game, and perhaps roughly dress hides. It would
not do any one of these things with neatness and accuracy, but
neatness and accuracy were qualities to which early Palæolithic
men paid little attention. This universal Chellean tool may be
described as a combined knife, saw, ax, scraper, and pick, performing
the various functions of these implements with notable
crudities but efficiently enough when wielded with muscular
strength.</p>

<p>The Chellean pick was made by striking a round or oval
nodule of flint with another stone and knocking off pieces. Most
of the detached flakes were large, as shown by the surfaces from
which they came off; perhaps most of the chips averaged a
square inch. Anything like fine work or evenness of outline
was therefore out of question. One can imagine that many tools
were spoiled, or broken in two, by the knocks to which they
were subjected in their manufacture. The flakes struck off fell
to the ground and were discarded. If the workman was sufficiently
skilful, and luck stayed with him, he would before long
be holding the sort of implement that has been described. Not
more than a few dozen strokes of the hammer stone would be
required to produce it.</p>

</figure>

<p>Some attempt has been made to distinguish variant forms of
Chellean tools, such as scrapers, planers, and knives. But some
of these identifications of particular types are uncertain, and at
best, the differences between the types are slight. It may be
said with approximate accuracy that the long Chellean period
possessed only the one tool; that this is the first definitely shaped
tool known to have been made by human hands; and that it
is therefore the concrete evidence of the first stage of that long
development which we call civilization.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><i>Acheulean.</i>—The Acheulean period brings to light a growing
specialization of forms and some new types. Rude scrapers,
knives, borers, can be distinguished. The flakes struck off are
finer than in the Chellean and the general workmanship averages
higher; but through the whole of the Acheulean there is no new
process. The Chellean methods of manufacture are improved
without an invention being added to them.</p>

<p><i>Mousterian.</i>—In the Mousterian period a retrogression would
at first sight seem to have occurred. Tools become smaller, less
regular in outline, and are worked on one side only. The whole
Mousterian period scarcely presents a single new type of implement
of such all-around serviceability as the Chellean pick.
Nevertheless the degeneration is only in the appearance of the
implements. Actually they are made by a new process, which
is more advanced than that followed in the Chellean and
Acheulean. In these earlier periods flakes were struck off until
the kernel of stone that remained was of the shape desired for
the tool. The Mousterian technique is distinguished by using
the flake instead of the core. This is the cause of Mousterian
tools being generally smaller and lighter.</p>

<p>Secondly, when the flake dulled by use, its edge was renewed
by fine chipping. The pieces detached in this secondary chipping
are so small that it would have been difficult to knock them
off and maintain any regularity of edge, for to detach a chip by
a blow means violent contact. If the blow is a bit feeble, the
chip that comes off is too small. If the artifact is struck too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
hard, too large a chip flies off and the implement is ruined.
Fine chips are better worked off by pressure than by impact.
A point is laid upon the surface near the edge. When this
point is pressed down at the proper angle and with proper firmness,
a scale flies off. With some practice the scales can be detached
almost equal in size. The point may be of softer material
than the stone. It is in the nature of flint, and of all stones
that approach glass in their structure, that they break easily
under pressure in definite planes or surfaces. Modern tribes
that still work flint generally employ as a pressing tool a piece
of bone or horn which comes to a somewhat rounded point. This
is usually attached to the end of a stick, to enable a better grip
of the working tool, the butt end being clamped under the elbow.
A tool of the same sort may have been employed in the Palæolithic.
The process of detaching the scales or secondary flakes
by pressure is known as “retouching.” Retouching allows
finer control than strokes delivered with a stone. The result is
that Mousterian implements, when at their best, possess truer
edges, and also greater variety of forms adapted to particular
uses, than those of preceding ages (<a href="#figure18">Fig. 18</a>, <i>b</i>).</p>

<p>In spite of their insignificant appearance, Mousterian tools
accordingly show advance in two points. First, the flake is used.
Secondly, two processes instead of one are followed; the knocking
off of the flake followed by its retouching.</p>

<p><i>Aurignacian.</i>—With the Mousterian the Lower Palæolithic
has ended. In several activities of life, such as art and religion,
the Upper Palæolithic represents a great advance over the
Lower Palæolithic. Yet it seems that the mental energies of
the Aurignacian people must have been pretty well absorbed by
their new occupations and inventions, for their tools are largely
the same retouched flakes as those the Mousterian had already
employed. The Aurignacian carried on the stone technique of
the Mousterian much as the Acheulean previously had carried
on that of the Chellean.</p>

<p><i>Solutrean.</i>—The Solutrean seems to have been a relatively
brief period, and to have remained localized, for implements
dating from it are the scarcest of any from the six divisions of
the Old Stone Age. There was a distinct advance of interest
in stone work during the Solutrean. The process of retouching,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
without being fundamentally altered, was evidently much better
controlled than before. The best Solutrean workers were retouching
both sides of their tools instead of one side only, as
in the past, and working over not only the edge or point but
the entire surface of their artifacts. One of the characteristic
implements of their time was a laurel-leaf-shaped blade which
has often been considered a spear point, but would also have
been an effective knife and may often have been used as such.
This has the surface of both sides, from tip to butt, finished in
even retouching, and is equaled in excellence of workmanship
only by the best of the spear points chipped by modern savages
(<a href="#figure18">Fig. 18</a>, <i>c</i>).</p>

<p>Of course this was not the only stone implement which the
Solutrean people knew. They made points with a single shoulder
at the butt, as if for mounting, and had crude forms which
represented the types of earlier periods. This partial conservatism
is in accord with the general observation already stated,
that lower types tend to persist even after higher ones have been
invented; and that because a period is determined by its best
products it by no means follows that simpler ones are lacking.</p>

<p><i>Magdalenian.</i>—The sixth period of the Old Stone Age, the
Magdalenian, resembles the Mousterian in seeming at first glance
to show a retrograde development. The retouching process was
carried out with less skill, perhaps because the Magdalenians
were devoting themselves with more interest to bone than to
stone. Magdalenian retouched implements are less completely
worked out and less beautifully regular than those of Solutrean
times. One reason for this decline was that another technique
was coming to prevail. This technique had begun to come into
use earlier, but its typical development was Magdalenian. It
was a process which, on account of its simplicity, once it was
mastered, was tending to make the art of retouching unnecessary.
This new method was the trick of detaching, from a suitable
block of flint, long straight-edged flakes, by a single blow, somewhat
on the principle by which a cake of ice can be split evenly
by a well guided stroke of the pick. The typical Magdalenian
implement of stone is a thin flake several inches long, triangular
or polygonal in cross section; in other words, a long narrow
prism (<a href="#figure18">Fig. 18</a>, <i>d</i>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>To detach such a flake, flint of rather even grain is necessary,
and the blow that does the work must be delivered on a precise
spot, at a precise angle, and within rather narrow limits of
force. This means that the hammer or striking tool cannot well
come in direct contact with the flint. A short pointed piece,
something like a nail or a carpenter’s punch, and probably made
in the prehistoric days of horn or bone, is set on a suitable spot
near the edge of the block of flint, and is then tapped smartly
with the hammer stone. A single stroke slices off the desired
flake. The sharp edges left on the block where the flake has
flown off can be used to start adjacent flakes, and thus all the
way round the block, the workman progressing farther and farther
in, until nearly the whole of his core has been split off into
strips.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span> Flakes struck from a core and reassembled. Modern workmanship

</figure>

<p>This Magdalenian process, which was in use ten, fifteen, and
perhaps twenty thousand years ago, survived, or was reinvented,
in modern times. It is only a few years ago that flints were
being struck off by English workmen for use on flintlock muskets
exported to Africa. The modern Englishman worked with a
steel hammer instead of a bone rod and cobblestone, but his
technique was the same. <a href="#figure19">Figure 19</a> shows the complete lot of
flakes into which a block has been split, and which were subsequently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
laid together so as to reform the stone in its original
shape. Similar flakes made of obsidian, a volcanic glass similar
to flint in its properties, are still being produced in the Indian
districts of interior Mexico for use as razors (<a href="#figure18">Fig. 18</a>, <i>e</i>).</p>

<p>The Magdalenian method of flint working gives the smoothest
and sharpest edge. It is not adapted for making heavy instruments,
but it yields an admirable knife. The process is also
expeditious.</p>

<p><i>Summary.</i>—The successive steps in the art of stone working
in the Palæolithic may be summarized thus:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">Chellean: Coarse flakes detached by blows from the core, which becomes
the implement.</p>

<p class="hanging">Acheulean: Same process applied to more varied forms.</p>

<p class="hanging">Mousterian: Flake detached by a blow is sharpened into a tool by
retouching by pressure on one side only.</p>

<p class="hanging">Aurignacian: Same with improved retouching applied.</p>

<p class="hanging">Solutrean: Both surfaces of implement wholly retouched.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="section73">73. <span class="smcap">Other Materials: Bone and Horn</span></h3>

<p>Stone implements must perhaps always remain in the foreground
of our understanding of the Old Stone Age because they
were made so much more numerously than other objects, or at
any rate have been preserved so much more abundantly, that
they will supply us with the bulk of our evidence. At the same
time it would be an error to believe that the life of these men
of long ago was filled with the making and using of stone tools
to the exclusion of everything else. Gradually during the last
fifty years, through unremittingly patient explorations and the
piecing of one small discovery to another, there has accumulated
a fair body of knowledge of other sides of the life of Palæolithic
men. There is every reason to believe that as time goes on we
shall learn more and more about them, and thus be able to
reconstruct a reasonably complete and vivid picture of their
behavior.</p>

<p>Implements of bone and horn are next most abundant after
those of stone, but it is significant that the Lower Palæolithic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
still dispensed with these materials. In the Chellean and
Acheulean stations, although broken bones of devoured animals
occur, bone was not shaped. In the Mousterian this material
first came into use, but as yet only as so-called “anvils” on
which to chip flint or cut, and not as true tools.</p>

<p>One of the changes that most prominently mark the passage
from the Lower to the Upper Palæolithic is the sudden development
in the use of bone at the beginning of the Aurignacian,
and then of reindeer horn. These materials came more and more
into favor as time went on. The Aurignacians had bone awls
or pins, polishers, paint tubes of hollowed reindeer leg bone,
and points with a grooved base for hafting, generally construed
as javelin heads. In the Solutrean, eyed needles were added.
The greatest development was attained in the Magdalenian.
Bone javelin and spear heads were now made in a variety of
forms, with bases pointed, beveled, or grooved. Hammers,
chisels or wedges, and perforators were added to the list of bone
tools. Whistles and perhaps flutes were blown. Reindeer antler
was employed for carved and perforated lengths of horn, “rods
of command” or magic, they are usually called; as well as for
harpoons and throwers, to be discussed below.</p>

<p>By the close of the Palæolithic, objects of organic substances
began to approach in frequency those of flint. This may well
have been a sort of preparation for the grinding and polishing
of stone which is the distinctive technique of the New Stone Age.
Bone cannot well be chipped or retouched. It must be cut,
ground, or rubbed into shape. The Neolithic people therefore
may be said to have extended to stone a process which their
predecessors of the Upper Palæolithic were familiar with but
had failed to apply to the harder substance.</p>

<h3 id="section74">74. <span class="smcap">Dress</span></h3>

<p>The slender bone needle provided with an eye which the
Solutrean and Magdalenian added to the primitive awl implies
thread and sewing. It may be concluded therefore that, at least
from the middle of the Upper Palæolithic on, the people of
Europe went clothed in some sort of fitted garments. It would
be going too far to assert that the Neandertal men ran about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
naked as the lower animals. Several inventions which they had
made compel us to attribute to them enough intelligence to lead
them to cover themselves with skins when they felt cold. But
they may have been too improvident, or habituated to discomfort,
to trouble even to dress hides. At any rate there is no
positive indication that they regularly clothed themselves. By
contrast, the sewing of the Upper Palæolithic Cro-Magnons
marked a considerable advance.</p>

<p>Ornament may have been earlier than clothing. The paint
of the Aurignacians decorated their own bodies and those of
their dead. About their necks and waists they hung rows of
perforated shells and teeth. More of these have been found on
the skeletons of males than of females. By the Magdalenian,
there was sophistication enough to lead to the carving of artificial
shells and teeth out of ivory; and amber was beginning
to be transported from the German coast to Southern France.</p>

<h3 id="section75">75. <span class="smcap">Harpoons and Weapons</span></h3>

<p>Towards the end of the Upper Palæolithic, in the Magdalenian,
the harpoon came into extensive use. The shafts have
of course long since decayed, but many of the reindeer antler
heads have remained intact. At first these were notched with
barbs along one edge only. In the later Magdalenian the barbs
were cut on both sides. The harpoon differs from the simple
spear or javelin in having its head detachable from the shaft.
The two are fitted together by a socket. If the prey, be it fish
or mammal, is not killed by the first throw, its struggles to
escape shake the shaft loose, while the barbs hold the head firmly
imbedded in its body. A line is attached to the head and tied
to the shaft or held in the hand of the hunter. The animal is
thus kept from escaping. During the Magdalenian the line was
kept from slipping off the head by one or two knobs near the
butt. In the subsequent Azilian period the head was perforated,
as is the modern Eskimo practice. The harpoon is really a
rather complicated instrument: it consists of at least three pieces—head,
shaft, and line.</p>

<p>Another device which the Magdalenians shared with the
Aztecs, the Eskimo, and some other modern peoples, is the spear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
thrower or atlatl. This is a sort of rod or handle, one end of
which is grasped by the fingers while the other engages the butt
end of the harpoon or dart. The hand only steers the shaft at
the beginning of its flight: the propulsion comes from the
thrower. The instrument may therefore be described as a device
for artificially lengthening the human arm and thus imparting
greater velocity and length of flight to the weapon. There is
without doubt considerable ingenuity involved in this apparatus,
both in its invention and in its successful use. A person unskilled
in bodily movements would never hit upon the invention;
nor could a race of high native dexterity acquire proficiency
in the art of hunting with the thrower until each individual
was willing to practise for a considerable period. It may
once more be concluded, accordingly, that by the end of the
Palæolithic, civilization had developed to a point where men
were much readier to undergo protracted training and forbearance
than they had been at the beginning of the period.</p>

<p>One instrument that we are wont to associate with the beginnings
of civilization, because of its almost universal employment
by savages of to-day, is the bow and arrow. So strong has the
preconception been that the Palæolithic peoples must have been
like modern savages, that time and time again it has been assumed
that they possessed the bow. There is no convincing evidence
to show that this was so, and a good deal of negative evidence
to establish that they were unacquainted with the weapon.
All the Palæolithic remains of flint, bone, or horn, which at
times have been interpreted as arrow points, are more conservatively
explained as knives or heads of darts. The prevailing
opinion is that the bow was not invented until the Neolithic.
This would make the weapon only about ten thousand years old—a
hoary antiquity, indeed, but recent as compared with the
knife, the spear, and even the harpoon. The reason for this
lateness in the invention of the bow and arrow is probably to be
sought in the delicacy of the instrument. It is not essentially
more complex than the harpoon, certainly not more complex
than the harpoon impelled by the spear thrower. But it involves
much finer adjustments. A poorly made harpoon is of course
inferior to a well-made one, but may be measurably effective.
It may retrieve game half the time. But a bow which falls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
below a certain standard will not shoot at all, or will shoot so
feebly as to have a zero efficiency. In fact, one of the things
that students of the beginnings of culture have long been puzzled
about is how the bow and arrow could have been invented. Most
other inventions can be traced through a series of steps, each
of which, although incomplete, achieved a certain utility of its
own. But, other than toys or musical instruments, no implement
has yet been found, or even satisfactorily imagined, which was
not yet a bow, which would still serve a purpose, and which,
by addition or improvement, could give rise to the bow.</p>

<h3 id="section76">76. <span class="smcap">Wooden Implements</span></h3>

<p>Wood is likely to have been used by primitive men for one
purpose or another from the very earliest times. Even “half
men” of the “missing link” type, it may be believed, would
in case of need pick up a stick or wrench a limb from a tree
to serve them as a club. But we do not know when human
beings first began to fashion wood into definite implements by
working it with their stone tools. Wood is too perishable a
substance to have stood any chance of being preserved from so
long distant a past.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the first employment of wood is indirect.
Many of the Mousterian chipped flakes are of such size and shape
that they could have been operated much more effectively had
they been mounted on a handle. Possibly therefore the process
of hafting or handling had come to be practised in the Mousterian,
although there is no specific evidence to this effect. In
the Upper Palæolithic, wood was certainly used to a considerable
extent. The harpoon and dart heads, for instance, must have
had wooden shafts.</p>

<p>A true ax is not known from the Old Stone Age and seems
to have been invented in the Neolithic. The distinctive factor
of the instrument, upon which its utility largely depends, is the
straightness and smoothness of the edge; and such an edge is
best attained by the grinding process. Even the unground axes
of the earliest Neolithic depended on a single stroke to provide
them with the required straight cutting edge. We may believe,
therefore, that the Palæolithic peoples worked wood in the manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
familiar to us from the practices of many modern savage
races. They split it, rubbed it, and burned it into shape, rather
than trying to chop it.</p>

<h3 id="section77">77. <span class="smcap">Fire</span></h3>

<p>One of the most fundamental of human arts is the use of fire.
It is also one of the most ancient. Its occurrence is easily traced,
at any rate in deposits that have not been disturbed by nature,
through the presence of charred bones, lumps of charcoal, and
layers of ash. Charcoal crumbles easily, but its fragments are
practically imperishable. Its presence in considerable quantities
in any station, particularly if the coal is accumulated in pockets,
is therefore sure proof that the people who occupied the site
burned fires for warmth, or cooking, or both purposes. The use
of fire has been established throughout the part of the Palæolithic
when men lived in caves and under rock shelters; that is,
during the Mousterian and Upper Palæolithic.</p>

<p>The Chellean and Acheulean deposits are so much older and
more open, and in many cases have been washed over so much by
rainfall and by streams, that, if the men of these periods did
use fire, as they may well have done, its evidences might have
been pretty generally obliterated.</p>

<p>Whether early Palæolithic men knew how to make fire, or
whether they only found it and kept it alive, is more difficult
to say. They could easily have acquired it in the first place
from trees struck by lightning or from other occasional natural
agencies. Then, recognizing its value, they may well have nursed
it along, lighting one hearth from another. Yet at some time
in the Palæolithic the art of producing fire at will, by friction
between two pieces of wood, is almost certain to have been invented.
One may infer this from the general similarity of level
of Magdalenian civilization to that of modern savages, all of
whom practise the art of ignition. But in the nature of things
it would be difficult to find evidence bearing on this point from
more than ten thousand years ago. It can be assumed that man
is likely to have lived first for a long period in a condition in
which he knew and used and preserved fire, yet was not able to
produce it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<h3 id="section78">78. <span class="smcap">Houses</span></h3>

<p>Although Palæolithic man worked so much in stone, he did not
build in it. Hence our knowledge of the kinds of shelters he
made for himself is almost <i>nil</i>. There are Upper Palæolithic
“tectiform” paintings which look as if they might be attempts
to depict houses. It is clear, moreover, that in this period the
general development of the mechanical arts was sufficiently
advanced to allow of the construction of some sort of rude
edifices.</p>

<p>It is conceivable that as far back as the Lower Palæolithic
simple shelters of branches were constructed, or that skins may
have been hung over a few poles to keep off wind and rain. On
account of the perishable nature of the materials involved, it
happens that there is no proof either for or against such a supposition.
It is possible that in time, when patient excavations
shall have revealed some particularly well preserved site, the
holes may yet be found in which the posts of a Palæolithic hut
were once set. In case of a fire, the carbonized stumps might
prove to have been preserved in place; or the butts of the posts
might have gradually rotted away and the space once occupied
by them have become filled with an earthy material of different
color and consistency from the surrounding soil. In this lucky
event, even the size and shape of the house might be reconstructed
from the relative positions of the post holes. From
evidence of just this sort some interesting ideas have actually
been obtained as to the houses and village plan of Neolithic
European peoples. Of course, the chances are much less that
remains of this sort would be preserved from the Palæolithic.
But the method would be equally applicable if favorable conditions
offered; and it is in some such way that we may hope in
the future to learn a little about the earliest habitations that
mankind constructed. In any event the example serves to illustrate
the indirect and delicate means of which the student of
prehistory must consistently avail himself in his reconstructions
of the past; and gives reason to believe that all that has been
learned about early man in the last fifty years is very little in
comparison with what the ensuing generation and century will
bring to light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<h3 id="section79">79. <span class="smcap">Religion</span></h3>

<p>It has already been said that knowledge of religion, a non-material
thing, can be preserved from the remote past only by
the most roundabout means. It is conceivable that the people
of the Upper Palæolithic spent at least as much time in ceremonial
observances as in working flint. Analogy with modern
uncivilized tribes would make us think that this is quite likely.
But the stone tools have remained lying in the earth, while the
religious customs went out of use thousands of years ago and
the beliefs were forgotten. Yet this is known: As far back as
the Mousterian, thirty thousand years ago, certain practices
were being observed by the Neandertal race of western Europe
which modern savages observe in obedience to the dictates of
their religion. When these people of the Mousterian laid away
their dead, they put some of their belongings with them. When
existing nations do this, it is invariably in connection with a
belief in the continued existence of the soul after death. We
may reasonably conclude therefore that even in this long distant
period human beings had arrived at a crude recognition
of the difference between flesh and spirit; in short, religion
had come into being. Even to say that Neandertal man did not
know whether his dead were dead, implies his recognition of
something different from life in the body, for he recognized of
course that the body had become different. Whether the Neandertal
race already held to the existence of spirits distinct from
man or superior to him, it is impossible to say.</p>

<p>The Upper Palæolithic Cro-Magnon peoples laid out the
bodies of their dead and sometimes folded them. They also
sometimes painted the bodies, and buried flint implements and
food in the graves. That is, funerary practices were becoming
established. We may assume that hand in hand with this development
of observances there went a growth of ritual and
belief.</p>

<h3 id="section80">80. <span class="smcap">Palæolithic Art</span></h3>

<p>The highest achievement of the men of the Old Stone Age is
their art. The perfection to which they carried this art is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
simply astounding in view of the comparative meagerness of
their civilization otherwise. It is also remarkable how full-fledged
this achievement sprang into existence. The Lower
Palæolithic seems to have been without a trace of art. With
the Aurignacian, simple carving and painting appear; and while
the acme of accomplishment was not reached until the Magdalenian,
the essential foundations of a graphic art of high order
were laid in the late Aurignacian.</p>

<p>The Upper Palæolithic people carved in ivory, bone, and
horn; they incised or engraved on flattened and rounded surfaces
of the same material; and they carved and painted the
walls of caves. They modeled at times in clay and perhaps in
other soft materials, and may have drawn or painted pictures
on skins and on exposed rock surfaces, for all we know; we can
judge only by the remains that have actually come down to us.
This art is not a child-like, struggling attempt to represent
objects in the rough, nor is it a mere decorative playing with
geometric figures. These first human artists set boldly to work
to depict; and while their technique was simple, it was carried
to a remarkably high degree of perfection. A few bold strokes
gave the outlines of an animal, but they gave it with such
fidelity that the species can often be recognized at a glance. The
Cro-Magnon people must have developed a high power of mental
concentration to be able to observe and reproduce so closely.
The most gifted individuals perhaps practised assiduously to
attain their facility.</p>

<p>Palæolithic art is very different from that of most modern
savages. The latter often work out decorative patterns of some
complexity, richness, and æsthetic value, but when they attempt
to depict nature, they usually fail conspicuously. The lines are
crude and wavering. Any head, body, and tail with four legs
stands for almost any animal. It is a reasonable representation
of an abstraction that they accomplish, not the delineation of
what is characteristic in the visible form. Both observer and
painter, among most living savages, are supposed to know beforehand
that the drawing represents a fox and not a bear. At
most, some symbols are added, such as a bushy tail for a fox
or a fin for a whale. It is only in rare cases that any but advanced
nations break away from these primitive tendencies and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
learn to draw things as they really appear. The ancient Egyptians
developed such a faculty, and among savages the Bushmen
are remarkably gifted, but, on the whole, successful realistic
art is an accomplishment of high civilization. It is therefore
something of a mystery how the Cro-Magnon men of the Aurignacian
brought themselves to do so well.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp50" id="figure20" style="max-width: 14.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure20.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span> Limestone statuette from Willendorf, Austria. Characteristic
of Aurignacian treatment of the female figure: the face and limbs
are abbreviated or only indicated; the parts concerned with reproduction
are exaggerated.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In sculpture their first efforts were directed upon figurines.
These mostly represent the human female. The head, hands,
and feet are either absent or much abbreviated. In the body,
those parts having to do with reproduction and fecundity are
usually heavily exaggerated, but at the same time given with
considerable skill (<a href="#figure20">Fig. 20</a>). It is likely that these statuettes
served some religious cult. At any rate, the carvings in three
dimensions often represent the human figure, whereas two-dimensional
drawings, etchings, and paintings mostly represent
animals and are much more successful than the human outlines.
In the Magdalenian, miniature sculpture of animals was added
to that of the human figure (<a href="#figure21">Fig. 21</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>Success in seizing the salient outline was the earliest characteristic
of the paintings and drawings. The first Aurignacian
engravings are invariably in profile and usually show only the
two legs on the immediately visible side. In time the artists
also learned to suggest typical positions and movements—the
motion of a reindeer lowering its head to browse, the way an
angry bull switches his tail or paws the ground, the curl of the
end of an elephant’s trunk (Figs. <a href="#figure22">22</a>, <a href="#figure24">24</a>). In the Magdalenian,
all four legs are usually depicted, and the profile, although remaining
most frequent, as it is most characteristic, is no longer
the only aspect. There are occasional pictures of animals from
before or behind, or of a reindeer with its head turned backward.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure21" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure21.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span> Horse carved in mammoth ivory. From Lourdes, France.
The spirited portrayal of the neck, ears, eyes, and mouth parts is characteristic
of Magdalenian sculpture.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are also some devices which look like the beginnings
of attempts at composition. The effect of a row of reindeer is
produced by drawing out the first few in some detail, and then
suggesting the others by sketching in their horns (<a href="#figure23">Fig. 23</a>).
Artists were no longer content, in the Magdalenian, always to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
do each animal as a solitary, static unit. They were trying, with
some measure of success, to represent the animals as they moved
in life and perhaps to combine several of them into one coherent
picture or to suggest a setting.</p>

<p>By this time they had also acquired considerable ability in
handling colors. The Aurignacian and Solutrean artists restricted
themselves to monochrome effects. They engraved or
painted outlines and sometimes accentuated these by filling them
in with pigment. But the best of the later painters in the Magdalenian—those,
for instance, who left their frescoes on the walls
of the famous cave of Altamira in Spain—used three or four
colors at once and blended these into transition tones.</p>

were crude, he was able to depict the animal’s action with remarkable
vigor. Note the roll of the eye, the flapping ears, the raised tail expressive
of anger.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While animals constitute the subjects of probably four-fifths
of the specimens of Palæolithic art, and human beings most of
the remainder, representations of plants and unrealistic decorative
designs are known. The latter seem to have begun to be
specially prevalent in the latest Magdalenian, as if in preparation
of the conventionalized, non-naturalistic art of the transitional
Azilian and Neolithic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<h3 id="section81">81. <span class="smcap">Summary of Advance in the Palæolithic</span></h3>

<p>The history of civilization has herewith been outlined from
its first dim beginnings to about twelve thousand years ago—say
to the neighborhood of 10,000 B.C., as the historian would
put it. Progress is immensely slow at the outset, but gradually
speeds up. The tabulation in <a href="#figure25">Figure 25</a> summarizes some of the
principal features of this evolution. This diagram does not pretend
to be complete; it does try to include some of the most
important and representative inventions, arts, and accomplishments
of the Old Stone Age.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure23" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure23.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span> Magdalenian engraving of a herd of reindeer, found in the
grotto of La Mairie, France. The impressionistic manner enabled the
artist to suggest rather effectively a large herd while drawing out only
four animals.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Thus it appears that the Chellean and Acheulean periods are
characterized essentially by a single art, that of chipping implements
on a core of flint, plus perhaps the use of fire. The Mousterian
evinces progress: stone tools are now made from the flake
as well as the core, possibly are sometimes hafted, bone is occasionally
utilized, and there are the first indications of budding
religion; four or five entries are required to represent these
culture traits.</p>

<p>The greatest advance comes from the Mousterian to the
Aurignacian; in other words, between the Lower and the Upper
Palæolithic. Three times as many accomplishments are listed
as in the Mousterian, and whole series of new inventions are now
first met with: body ornaments, bone implements, æsthetic
products. This sudden leap in the figures goes far to signalize
the importance of the division between the Upper and the Lower
Palæolithic. In the Solutrean and Magdalenian still further<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
inventions or refinements appear, until, when the Old Stone
Age comes to a close,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the stock of human civilization may be
described as perhaps twenty times as rich as at the beginning.
These figures are not to be taken too literally. The tabulation
could easily have been compiled on a more elaborate basis. But
even then the relative proportion of culture features in each
period would remain approximately as here given. And as
regards the general fact of accumulation of civilization, and its
range and nature, the diagram may be accepted as substantially
representative of what happened.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>The end of the Palæolithic thus sees man in possession of a
number of mechanical arts which enable him to produce a considerable
variety of tools in several materials: sees him controlling
fire; cooking food; wearing clothes, and living in definite
habitations; probably possessing some sort of social grouping,
order, and ideas of law and justice; clearly under the influence
of some kind of religion; highly advanced in the plastic arts;
and presumably already narrating legends and singing songs.
In short, many fundamental elements of civilization were established.
It is true that the sum total of knowledge and accomplishments
was still pitifully small. The most advanced of the
Old Stone Age men perhaps knew and could do about one thing
for every hundred that we know and can do. A whole array of
fundamental inventions—the bow and arrow, pottery, domestication
of animals and plants—had not yet been attempted, and
they do not appear on the scene until the Neolithic. But in spite
of the enormous gaps remaining to be filled in the Neolithic and
in the historic period, it does seem fair to say that many of the
outlines of what civilization was ultimately to be had been substantially
blocked out during the Upper Palæolithic. Most of
the framework was there, even though but a small fraction of
its content had yet been entered.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="section82">82. <span class="smcap">Heredity</span></h3>

<p>The first of the several factors through which it is logically
possible to explain the life and conduct and customs of any
people is race or heredity: in other words, the inborn tendencies,
bodily and mental, of the people that carry these customs. At
first sight it may seem that this element of race might be quite
influential. Since peoples differ in inherited characteristics of
body—complexion, features, hair, eye color, head form, and the
like—these bodily inherited peculiarities ought to be accompanied
by mentally inherited traits, such as greater or less inclination
to courage, energy, power of abstract thought, mechanical
ingenuity, musical or æsthetic proclivities, swift reactions, ability
to concentrate, gift of expression. Such racial mental traits,
again, might conceivably be expressed in the conduct and culture
of each people. Races born to a greater activity of the
mechanical faculties would achieve more or higher inventions,
those innately gifted in the direction of music would develop
more subtly melodious songs, and so on.</p>

<p>Yet in every particular case it is difficult or impossible to
establish by incontrovertible evidence that heredity is the specific
cause of this accomplishment, of this point of view, or of this
mode of life; that it is the determining factor to such and such
degree of such and such customs. This is not a denial of the
probability that inborn racial differences exist. It is an affirmation
of the difficulty, discussed in Chapters <a href="#CHAPTER_I">I</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_IV">IV</a>, and <a href="#CHAPTER_V">V</a>, of
knowing what is inborn; and more specifically, of the difficulty
of tracing particular customary activities back to particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
racial qualities. The problem of connecting specific race traits
with specific phenomena of culture or group conduct, such as
settled life, architecture in stone, religious symbolism, and the
like,—of determining how much of this type of architecture or
symbolism is instinctive in the race and how much of it is the
result of traditional or social influences,—remains unsolved.</p>

<p>For example, should one try to apply to the explanation of
the mode of life or culture of the Indians of the Southwestern
United States biological facts, such as their head form, one
would be confronted by the difficulty that long heads are characteristic
of some of the town-building tribes, or Pueblos, and
also of some of the tribes living in brush huts. Broad heads are
also found among both the settled and nomadic tribes. The
Pueblo Taos and non-Pueblo Pima are narrow-headed, the
Pueblo Zuñi and non-Pueblo Apache broad-headed. So with the
pulse rate, which has been already mentioned (§ <a href="#section70">70</a>) as unusually
slow among the Southwestern Indians. It is the same
for the nomadic Apache who lived by fighting, and for the Hopi
and Zuñi who are famous for their timidity and gentleness.
Similar cases might be cited almost endlessly. It is evident that
they are of a kind with the lack of correspondence between race
and speech, or race and nationality, among the European
peoples.</p>

<h3 id="section83">83. <span class="smcap">Geographical Environment</span></h3>

<p>When it comes to the second factor by which culture might
theoretically be explained—physical environment or geography—similar
difficulties are encountered.</p>

<p>It is of course plain that a primitive tribe under the equator
would never invent the ice box, and that the Eskimo will not
keep their food and water in buckets of bamboo, although it is
possible that if the Eskimo had had bamboo carried to them by
ocean currents, they would have been both glad and able to use
it. The materials and opportunities provided by nature may
be made use of by each people, while other materials not being
provided, other arts or customs can therefore not be developed.
But evidently this correspondence is mainly negative. Not performing
an act because one lacks the opportunity by no means<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
proves that the opportunity will necessarily lead to the performance.
Two nations will live where there is ice to store and
one will invent and the other fail to invent the ice chest. Whole
series of peoples possess bamboo and clay, and yet some of them
draw water in bamboo joints and others in pots. Obviously,
natural environment does impose certain <i>limiting conditions</i> on
human life; but equally obviously, it does not <i>cause</i> inventions
or institutions.</p>

<p>The native Australians have wood and cord and flint but do
not make bows and arrows. Their civilization had not advanced
to the point where they were able to devise an efficient bow, and
the requisite idea failed to be carried to them from elsewhere
as it was to other peoples who also did not invent the weapon.
The Polynesians, on the other hand, seem once to have had the
weapon, as evidenced by their retaining it as a toy, but to have
disused it, perhaps because they specialized on fighting with
spears and clubs. Modern civilized people fight at long range,
but have let bows go out of use, except for sport, because their
knowledge of metallurgy and chemistry centuries ago progressed
to the point where they could produce firearms. Development
or lack of development or specialization of other cultural activities—social
causes—thus determine more directly than other
factors whether or not a people employ the bow and arrow. Of
those mentioned, the Australians are the only ones with whom
a factor of natural environment might be alleged to enter:
namely, their isolation, which cut them off from communications
and the opportunity to learn from other races. Yet such isolation
is as much a matter of inability to traverse space as it is
a matter of physical distance. A developed art of navigation
would have abolished the Australian isolation. Thus, this seemingly
environmental cause of a cultural fact depends for its
effectiveness on a co-existing cultural cause. It is the latter
which is the most immediate or specific cause.</p>

<p>In general, then, it may be concluded that the directly determining
factors of cultural phenomena are not nature which gives

technology and advancement of the group; in short, historical
or cultural influences.</p>

<h3 id="section84">84. <span class="smcap">Diet</span></h3>

<p>The greater part of the Southwest is arid. Fish are scarce.
The result is that most of the tribes get little opportunity to
fish. Most of these Southwestern Indians will not eat fish; in
fact, think them poisonous. This circumstance might lead to
the following inference: nature does not furnish fish in abundance;
therefore the Indians got out of the habit of eating them,
and finally came to believe them poisonous. At first blush this
may seem a sufficient explanation. But it is well to note that
the explanation has two parts and that only one of them has
to do with nature: the habit of not eating fish because they are
too scarce to make it worth while. As soon as one proceeds to
the second step, that the disuse led to aversion and then to a
false belief of poisonousness, one has gone on to a different
matter. Disuse, aversion, and belief lie wholly within the field
of human conduct. To derive a psychological phenomenon,
such as a belief, from another psychological phenomenon such
as a particular disuse, because this disuse is founded on a geographical
factor, would of course be a logical fallacy. It can
also be shown not to hold, since we prize caviar and oysters and
venison in proportion to their rarity. Scarcity in this case thus
leads to the contrary psychological attitude, and either fails to
establish beliefs or establishes favorable ones.</p>

<p>Again, either through a change in climate or through the improvement
of trade, a food that was scarce may become plentiful.
Or a people may remove to a new habitat, different from
that in which their customs of eating were formed. If environment
alone were the dominating cause of their customs, these
customs should then immediately alter. As a fact, a group
sometimes adheres to its old customs. The immediate cause of
such conservatism is habit or inertia or inclination toward superstition
or fear of taboo, all of which are mental reactions expressed
in folkways or social customs. Thus environment remains
at most a partial and indirectly operating cause.</p>

<p>A case in point is that of the Jews. It is often said that the
Jew’s prohibition against eating pork and oysters and lobsters
originated in hygienic considerations; that these were climatically
unsafe foods for him in Palestine. This explanation is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
more simple than true. Ancient Palestine was an arid country
in which hogs could not be raised with economic profit, and so
they were not raised; and the Philistine and Phœnician kept the
Jew from the coast along which he might have obtained shellfish.
Eating neither food, he happened to acquire a distrust
of them; having the distrust, he rationalized it by saying that
it was foreign and wicked and irreligious to act counter to his
habits—just like the Pueblo Indian; and in the end had the
Lord issue the prohibition for him. Yet this outcome is a long
way from the starting point of natural environment. The
environment may indeed be said to have furnished the first
occasion, but the determining causes of the taboos in the Mosaic
law are of an entirely different kind—distrust, custom, rationalization,
psychological or cultural factors. If doubt remains,
it is dispelled by the orthodox Jew of to-day, whose environment
thrusts some of his forbidden foods at him as economically
and hygienically satisfactory, whereas he still shudders at the
thought of tasting them.</p>

<p>If this sort of cultural crystallizing of custom and subsequent
rationalizing or ritual sanctioning takes place among civilized
and intelligent people, the like must occur among uncivilized
tribes.</p>

<h3 id="section85">85. <span class="smcap">Agriculture</span></h3>

<p>Attempts have been made to derive the invention of agriculture
from climatic factors. The first theory was that farming
took its rise in the tropics, where agriculture came naturally,
almost without effort, under a bounteous sky. Only after
people had acquired the habit of farming and had moved into
other less favorably endowed countries, did they take their agriculture
seriously in order to survive. But a second, equally
plausible, and quite contradictory theory has been advanced,
which looks toward the duress rather than the easy favors of
nature. On the basis of conditions among the modern Papago
Indians and the ancient inhabitants of the Southwest, it has
been argued that it must have been the peoples of arid countries
who invented agriculture, necessity driving them to it through
shortage of wild supplies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>Between such flat opposites, the choice is merely one of unscientific
guessing. In this particular case of the Southwest it
is certain that both guesses are wrong. Agriculture did not
come to the natives of this area because nature was favorable
or because it was unfavorable. It came because through increase
of knowledge and change of attitude, some people in the region
of Southern Mexico or Guatemala or beyond first turned agriculturists,
and from them the art was gradually carried, through
nation after nation, to the Southwestern tribes, and finally even
to the Indians of the North Atlantic coast.</p>

<p>The reasons for acceptance of this explanation are several.
First is the distribution of native agriculture, whose practice
was about equally spread in the two American continents with
its middle in or near Central America. If a geographical diffusion
of the art from a center took place, its radiation or
extension would probably be about equal to the north and south.
Then, the middle portions of the new world held the greatest
concentration of native population, such as would have tended
to produce a pressure in the direction of the establishment of
agriculture and would also normally be a consequence of the
continued custom of farming, as opposed to unsettled life.
Again, the Southwestern tribes planted only maize, beans, and
squashes; the Mexicans grew in addition tomatoes, chili peppers,
cacao, and sweet potatoes. It looks as if they had carried their
agriculture farther through having been at it longer. Then,
pottery has evidently spread out from the same center, and the
two arts seem to go hand in hand. Other evidence might be
adduced, such as archæological excavations and the botanical
fact that the home of the nearest wild relatives of the plants
cultivated in the Southwest is the central or middle American
area (§ <a href="#section183">183</a>).</p>

<p>In short, the Southwestern Indians did not farm because nature
induced them to make the invention. They did not make
the invention at all. A far away people made it, and from them
it was transmitted to the Southwest through a series of successive
tribal contacts. These contacts, which then are the
specific cause of Southwestern agriculture, constitute a human
social factor; a cultural or civilizational factor. Climatic or
physical environment did not enter into the matter at all, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
to render agriculture somewhat difficult in the arid Southwest,
though not difficult enough to prevent it. Had the Southwest
been thoroughly desert, agriculture could not have got a foot-hold
there. But this would be only a limiting condition; the
active or positive causes that brought about the Southwestern
agriculture are its invention farther South, the spread of the
invention to the North, and its acceptance there.</p>

<p>Of course this conclusion sheds no light on the causes of the
first invention in the middle American region. The ultimate
origin of the phenomenon has not been penetrated. But the
prevalence of agriculture in the aboriginal Southwest for several
thousand years past has been pretty certainly accounted
for, and by an explanation in terms of culture or civilization,
or the activity of societies of human beings.</p>

<h3 id="section86">86. <span class="smcap">Cultural Factors</span></h3>

<p>Such cultural causes constitute the third set or kind of factors
by which civilization is explainable. If the example just
discussed is representative, it is clear that cultural factors ordinarily
interpret more phenomena of civilization, and interpret
them more fully, than factors either of racial heredity or physical
environment.</p>

<p>It is different in zoölogy and botany. The forms and behavior
of animals and plants are explainable in terms of heredity
and environment because animals and plants have no culture.
It is true that the forms and behavior are determined also by
other animals and plants, their characteristics, habits, and abundance,
but these factors are in a larger sense part of the environment.
They are at any rate sub-cultural. But since anthropology
deals with beings whose distinctive trait in social relations
is the possession of the thing that we call culture, the
factors which biology employs are insufficient. It is not that
heredity and natural environment fail to apply to man, but that
they apply only indirectly and remotely to his civilization.
This fundamental fact has often been overlooked, especially in
modern times, because the biological sciences having achieved
successful increases of knowledge and understanding, the temptation
was great to borrow their method outright and apply it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
without serious modification to the human material of anthropology.
This procedure simplified the situation, but yielded
inadequate and illusory results. For a very long time the idea
that man possessed and animals lacked a soul influenced people’s
thought to such a degree that they scarcely thought of human
beings in terms of biological causality, of heredity and environment.
Then when a reaction began to set in, less than two centuries
ago, and it became more generally recognized that man
was an animal, the pendulum swung to the other extreme and
the tendency grew of seeing in him only the animal, the cultureless
being, and of either ignoring his culture or thinking
that it could be explained away by resolving it into the factors
familiar from biology. The just and wise course lies between.
The biological aspects of man must be interpreted in terms of
biological causation, his cultural aspects in terms first of all of
cultural causation. After they have been thus resolved, the
cultural causes may reduce to ultimate factors of heredity and
natural environment.</p>

<h3 id="section87">87. <span class="smcap">Cultural Distribution</span></h3>

<p>The Southwest also provides an example of how cultural phenomena
can be seen to be arranged geographically so as to yield
a meaning or to outline their history, without reference to climate
or natural influences. Near the center of the area, in
northern New Mexico and Arizona, live four groups of Pueblo
or town building Indians—the Hopi, Zuñi, Keres, and Tewa or
Tano—who represent a sort of élite of the native culture. They
farm, make pottery, accumulate wealth in turquoise, are governed
by priests, worship under a remarkably complex set of
rituals, which involve altars, masks, symbols of all sorts, and a
rude sort of philosophy.</p>

<p>As one goes from the Pueblo center to the less settled tribes,
one encounters first the Navaho, who are earth hut builders and
farm but little, yet share much of the Pueblo elaborateness of
ritual, including altars, masks, and symbols. A little farther
out, among the Apache and Pima, the cults have perceptibly
diminished in intricacy and symbolic value: altars and masks
are lacking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>The simplification increases among the more remote Mohave,
whose cults are based on dreams instead of priestly tradition.
Still farther, on the shores of the Pacific among the Luiseño
and Gabrielino, some Pueblo traits can still be found; cult altars
and pottery, for instance. But agriculture, homes of stone,
turquoise, priests, and the majority of Pueblo institutions are
unknown. Finally, still farther away in central California, the
Yokuts now and then show a culture trait reminiscent of the
Pueblos: grooved arrow straighteners, perhaps, or occasional
rudely made pottery vessels. These are suggestive bits; fragments
that have been whittled away or toned down. Pueblo
culture as a whole has vanished at this distance. In its place
the Yokuts possess quite different arts and institutions and
beliefs.</p>

<p>What is the significance of this gradual fading away of one
type of civilization and its replacement by others? Evidently
that certain influences have radiated out from the higher Pueblo
center, and that the effect of these has diminished in proportion
to the number of tribes they have passed through. The Pueblos
have succeeded in handing over the largest share of their civilization
to the adjacent Navaho—and no doubt also received most
from them. The Apache being more remote, were less affected;
and so on to the farthest limits of the influences.</p>

<p>It is also clear that a time element is involved. A people
receiving an art from another obviously acquires this later than
the inventors. Most traits which the central Pueblos share with
peripheral tribes may be assumed to have existed longer among
the Pueblos, simply because they possess more traits in their
culture and the flow has prevailingly been out from them. Thus
they make uncolored, two-colored, and three-colored pottery;
the tribes on the margin of the Southwest, uncolored pottery
only; those beyond the range of immediate Southwestern influence,
no pottery at all. Unless therefore there should be
special reasons suggestive of a degenerative loss of the art
among the marginal tribes—and no such reasons are known—the
conclusion is forced that Southwestern pottery was first
made by the ancestors of the Pueblos or their predecessors in
the central part of the area, presumably as plain ware, and that
thence knowledge of the art was gradually carried outward.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
However while simple pottery making was thus being taken up
by the tribes nearest to the Pueblo district, the Pueblos were
going ahead and learning to ornament vessels with painted designs.
In time this added art also spread to the neighbors, but
meanwhile these had passed knowledge of the first stage on to
the tribes still farther out than themselves; and meanwhile also
the Pueblos had perhaps gone on to a third stage, that of combining
colors in their decoration.</p>

<p>In this way, if nothing interrupted the even regularity of
the process, the focal people, with their lead in creating or inventing
or improving, might pass through half a dozen successive
stages of the art, or of many arts, while the outermost
peoples were just beginning to receive the rudiments. The
intermediate tribes would show attainment of a less or greater
number of stages in proportion to their distance from the center.
In this event the main facts concerning the pottery art of the
Southwest could be represented by a diagram of a step pyramid,
each level or step picturing a new increment to the basic art.
The Pueblos would be at the peak of the pyramid, five or six
steps high, the near-by tribes a step or two lower; and so on
to the outermost, who remain at, or have only recently attained
to, the first or lowest level; while beyond these would be the
non-pottery-making tribes wholly outside the Pueblo sphere of
influence.</p>

<p>Of course on the actual map the distribution of the various
forms or stages of pottery made does not work out with the
perfect regularity of our schematic diagram. Here and there a
tribe has migrated from its habitat and disturbed the symmetry
of arrangement; or the population of a district has been so thin
that it could live on wild products without resorting to agriculture,
so that it remained more or less nomadic and had no use
for fragile pottery; or a third group of tribes developed basket
making to a pitch which yielded excellent vessels, with the result
that they were satisfied and failed to take up pottery, or took
it up half-heartedly, so that the art remained stunted among
them—a stage or two more backward than their position would
lead one to expect. But on the whole pottery distribution in
the Southwest does follow the schematic arrangement with sufficient
closeness to warrant the assumption that the history of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
its development has been, at least in outline, as just reconstructed.</p>

<p>The facts conform still more closely to the step pyramid arrangement
when consideration is given not to pottery alone but
to the whole culture—agriculture, other arts, social forms, ritual,
religious organization, and the like. In that case Pueblo culture
is seen to comprise easily the greatest number of traits or component
parts, and these to grow fewer and fewer towards the
edges of the Southwest.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<h3 id="section88">88. <span class="smcap">Historical Induction</span></h3>

<p>The sort of conclusion here outlined is really a historical induction
drawn from the facts of culture distribution among
living but historyless tribes. Where documents are available,
the development, the growth of the pyramid itself, as it were,
can often be seen as it happened. Thus, about the year 100
A.D., Rome, Italy, France, England, Scotland, stood on successive
descending culture levels related to one another much like
Pueblo, Navaho, Pima, Mohave, Gabrielino; and also in the same
placement of ever more outward geographic situation.</p>

<p>Where written records fail, archæological remains sometimes
take their place. This is true of the Southwest, whose ancient
pottery, stone edifices and implements, and evidences of agriculture
remain as records of the past, telling a story only a little
less complete and direct than that of the Roman historians. One
of the archæologists of the Southwest has drawn up a pair of
diagrams to outline the culture history of the area as he has
reconstructed it from comparison of the prehistoric remains
(<a href="#figure26">Fig. 26</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>In all this story, what has become of natural environment and
heredity? They have dropped from sight. We have been able
to build up a reasonable and probably reliable reconstruction
of the course of development of civilization in an area without
reference to these two sets of factors. The reconstruction is in
terms of culture. Evidently environment and heredity are in
the main superfluous. They need not be brought in; are likely
to be confusing, to diminish the internal consistency of the
findings attained, if they are brought in. This is true in general,
not only of the instance chosen. By using environment
or heredity, one can often seem to explain certain selected features
of a culture, but the appearance is illusory, because one
need only be impartial to realize that one can never explain in
this way the whole of any culture. When, however, the explanation
can be made in terms of culture—always of course on
the basis of a sufficient knowledge and digestion of facts—it
applies increasingly to the whole of a civilization, and each portion
explained helps to explain better all other portions. The
cultural interpretation of culture is therefore progressive, and
ever more productive, whereas the environmental and the
biological-hereditary interpretation fail in proportion as they
are pushed farther; in fact can be kept going only by ignoring
larger and larger masses of fact to which they do not apply.</p>

<p>Historians, who may be described as anthropologists whose
work is made easy for them by the possession of written and
dated records, have tacitly recognized this situation. They may
now and then attribute some event or condition of civilization
to an inherent quality of a race, or to an influence of climate
or soil or sea. But this is mostly in their introductory chapters.
When they really get to grips with their subject, they explain
in terms of human thought and action, in other words, of culture.
It is true that they dwell more on personalities than
anthropologists do. But that is because the materials left them
by former historians are full of personalities and anecdotes.
And on the other hand, anthropological data are usually unduly
deficient in the personal element; they consist of descriptions
of customs, tools used by long forgotten individuals, and the
like. If anthropologists were able to recover knowledge of the
particular Pueblo woman who first painted a third color or a
glaze on a bowl, or of the priest who first instituted a masked
dance in order to make rain, we may be confident that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
would discuss these individuals. And such knowledge would
throw more light on the history of Southwestern pottery and
religion and culture generally than any amount of emphasis on
the number of inches of rainfall per year, or the pulse rate or
similar hypothetical and remote causes.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="section89">89. <span class="smcap">The Couvade</span></h3>

<p>The couvade is a custom to which the peasants of the Pyrenees
adhered until a century or two ago. When a couple had a child,
the wife got up and went about her daily work as well as she
might, while the husband went to bed to lie-in in state and receive
the visits of the neighbors. This was thought to be for the
good of the baby.</p>

<p>The same custom is found among the Indians of Brazil. They
believe that a violation of the custom would bring sickness or
ill luck upon the child. They look upon the child as something
new and delicate, a being requiring not only physical nurture
but the superadded protection of this religious or magical
practice.</p>

<p>The Basques of the Pyrenees and the Indians of Brazil are
of different race, separate origins, and without any known historical
contacts. The substantial identity of the custom among
them therefore long ago led to its being explained as the result
of the cropping out of an instinctive impulse of the human
mind. Tylor, for instance, held that whenever a branch of humanity
reached a certain hypothetical stage of development,
namely, that phase in which the reckoning of descent from the
mother began to transform into reckoning of descent from the
father, the couvade tended to appear spontaneously as a natural
accompaniment. The Basque peasants, of course, are a more
advanced people than the cannibalistic Brazilian natives. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
they are an old and a conservative people who have long lived
in comparative isolation in their mountainous district; and thus,
it might be argued, they retained the custom of the couvade as
a survival from the earlier transitional condition.</p>

<p>According to this method of explanation, the occurrence of
almost any custom, art, or belief among widely separated and
unrelated peoples is likely to be the result of the similar working
of the human mind under similar conditions. The cause
of cultural identities and resemblances, especially among primitive
or “nature” peoples, is not to be sought primarily in historical
factors, such as common origin, migrations, the propaganda
of religion, or the gradual diffusion of an idea, but is to
be looked for in something inherent in humanity itself, in inborn
psychological tendencies. This explanation is that of “Independent
Evolution.” It is also known as the doctrine of “Elementary
Ideas.”</p>

<p>Contrasting with this principle is that of borrowing—one
people learning an institution or belief from another, or taking
over a custom or invention. That borrowing has been considerably
instrumental in shaping the cultures of the more advanced
nations, is an obvious fact. People are Christians not through
the spontaneous unfolding of the whole dogma and ritual of
Christianity in each of them, nor even within their nation, but
because of the historically documented spread of Christianity
which is still going on. As a heathen people is converted by
missionaries to-day, so our North European ancestors were converted
by Romans, and the Romans by the Apostles and their
followers. When historical records are available, cultural borrowing
of this sort is generally easy to establish.</p>

<p>Borrowing can sometimes be shown as very likely even where
direct evidence is lacking. If two peoples that possess an institution
in common are known off-shoots one from the other, or
if they have had numerous trade relations, it is hardly necessary
to demonstrate the specific time and manner of transmission
between them. Supposing that a religion, an alphabet, and
perhaps a number of arts have passed from one nation to
another, one would normally ask for little further evidence that
a custom, such as the couvade, which they shared, had also been
originated by one and borrowed by the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<h3 id="section90">90. <span class="smcap">Proverbs</span></h3>

<p>Even where contacts are more remote, the geographical setting
of two peoples often makes borrowing seem likely. The custom
of uttering proverbs, for instance, has a significant distribution.
It seems astonishing that barbarous West African tribes should
possess a stock of proverbs as abundant and pithy as those current
in Europe. Not that the proverbs are identical. The negro
lacks too many articles, and too many of our manners, to allude
as we do. But he does share with us the habit of expressing
himself on certain situations with brief current sayings of
homely and instantly intelligible nature, that put a generality
into specific and concrete form. Thus: “One tree does not make
a forest”; “Run from the sword and hide in the scabbard”;
“If the stomach is weak, do not eat cockroaches”; “Distant firewood
is good firewood.”</p>

<p>The proverb tendency is a sufficiently general one to suggest
its independent origin in Africa and Europe. One’s first reaction
to the parallel is likely to be something like this: The
negro and we have formulated proverbs because we are both
human beings; the coining of proverbs is instinctive in humanity.
So it might be maintained. However, as soon as the
distribution of proverbs the world over is reviewed, it becomes
evident that their coining cannot be spontaneous, since the native
American race appears never to have devised a single true
proverb. On the other side are the Europeans, Africans,
Asiatics, and Oceanians who are addicted to the custom. Degree
of civilization evidently has nothing to do with the matter, because
in the Old World primitive and advanced peoples alike
use proverbs; whereas in the New World wild hunting tribes
as well as the most progressive nations like the Mayas have no
proverbs. The only inference which the facts allow is that there
must have been a time when proverbs were unknown anywhere—still
“uninvented” by mankind. Then, somewhere in the
Old World, they came into use. Perhaps it was a genius that
struck off the first sayings to be repeated by his associates and
then by his more remote environment. At any rate, the custom
spread from people to people until it extended over almost all
the eastern hemisphere. Some cause, however, such as geographical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
isolation, prevented the extension of the movement to
the western hemisphere. The American Indians therefore remained
proverbless because the invention was never transmitted
to them. Here, accordingly, is a case of the very incompleteness
of a distribution going far to illuminate the history of a
culture trait. The lack of parallelism between the hemispheres
disproves the explanation by instinctive independent origin.
This negative conclusion in turn tends strongly to establish the
probability that the custom was borrowed, perhaps from a single
source, in the four eastern continents.</p>

<h3 id="section91">91. <span class="smcap">Geographic Distribution</span></h3>

<p>Thus it appears that it is not always easy to settle the origin
and history of the phenomena of culture. Evidently, many
facts must be taken into consideration: above all, geographic
distribution. Because a habit is so well ingrained in our life
as to seem absolutely natural and almost congenital, it does not
follow that it really is so. The vast majority of culture elements
have been learned by each nation from other peoples, past and
present. At the same time there are unexpected limits to the
principle of borrowing. Transmission often operates over vast
areas and for long periods but at other times ceases.</p>

<p>Two reflections arise. The first is the discouraging but salutary
one that the history of civilization and its parts is an intricate
matter, not to be validly determined by off-hand guesses.
A second conclusion is that the geographic distribution of any
culture element is always likely to be a fact of prime importance
about it. It is because the Basques and the Brazilian Indians
are geographically separate that there is fair prima facie probability
of the couvade being the result of independent origin. It
is because of another geographic fact, that proverbs are known
throughout one hemisphere and lacking from the other, that it
must be inferred that they represent a borrowed culture trait.</p>

<p>In the following pages a number of culture elements will be
examined from the point of view of their distribution with the
aim of determining how far each of the two principles of parallel
invention and of borrowing may be inferred to have been operative
in regard to them. In place of “independent origin” the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
terms “parallelism” or “convergence” will be generally used.
As an equivalent of “borrowing” the somewhat less metaphorical
word “diffusion” will be applied. Well known historic
cases of diffusion, such as those of Christianity and Mohammedanism,
of Roman law, of the printing press and steam
engine and of the great modern mechanical inventions, will not
be considered. It is however well to keep these numerous cases
in the background of one’s mind as a constant suggestion that
the principle of diffusion is an extremely powerful one and still
active. In fact, the chief reason why early anthropologists did
not make more use of this principle seems to have been their
extreme familiarity with it. It was going on all about them,
so that in dealing with prehistoric times or with remote peoples,
they tended to overlook it. This was perhaps a natural error,
since the communications of savages and their methods of transmission
are so much more restricted than our own. Yet of
course even savages shift their habitations and acquire new
neighbors. At times they capture women and children from
one another. Again they intermarry; and they almost invariably
maintain some sort of trade relations with at least some of the
adjacent peoples. Slow as diffusion might therefore be among
them, it would nevertheless go on, and its lack of rapidity
would be compensated by the immense durations of time in the
prehistoric period. It is certain that the simpler inventions of
primitive man generally did not travel with the rapidity of the
printing press and telegraph and camera. But on the other
hand, instead of a generation or a century, there would often
be periods of a thousand or five thousand years for an invention
or a custom to spread from one continent to another. There is
thus every a priori reason why diffusion could be expected to
have had a very large part in the formation of primitive and
barbarous as well as advanced culture.</p>

<h3 id="section92">92. <span class="smcap">The Magic Flight</span></h3>

<p>There is one folk-lore plot with a distribution that leaves little
doubt as to its diffusion from a single source. This is the incident
known as the Magic Flight or Obstacle Pursuit. It recounts
how the hero, when pursued, throws behind him successively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
a whetstone, a comb, and a vessel of oil or other liquid.
The stone turns into a mountain or precipice; the comb into a
forest or thicket; the liquid into a lake or river. Each of these
obstacles impedes the pursuer and contributes to the hero’s final
escape. This incident has been found in stories told by the inhabitants
of every continent except South America. Its distribution
and probable spread are shown in <a href="#figure27">Fig. 27</a>.</p>

<p>While no two of the tales or myths containing the episode
of the Magic Flight are identical, there can be no serious doubt
as to a common source of the incident because of the co-existence
of the three separate items that make it up. If a people in
Asia and one in America each knew a story of a person who to
impede a pursuer spilt water on the ground which magically
grew into a vast lake, it would be dogmatic to insist on this as
proof of a historical connection between the two far separated
stories. Belief in the virtue of magic is world-wide, and it is
entirely conceivable that from this common soil of magical beliefs
the same episode might repeatedly have sprouted quite
independently. The same reasoning would apply to the incident
of the transformation of the stone and of the comb, as long
as they occurred separately. The linking of the three items,
however, enormously decreases the possibility of any two peoples
having hit upon them separately. It would be stretching coincidence
pretty far to believe that each people independently
invented the triple complex. It is also significant that the
number of impeding obstacles is almost always three. In the
region of western Asia and Europe where the tale presumably
originated, three is the number most frequently employed in
magic, ritual, and folk-lore. Among the American Indians,
however, three is scarcely ever thus used, either four or five
replacing it according to the custom pattern of the particular
tribe. Nevertheless, several American tribes depart from their
usual pattern and mention only three obstacles in telling this
story.</p>

<p>This instance introduces a consideration that is of growing
importance in culture history determinations. If a trait is composed
of several elements which stand in no necessary relation
to each other, and these several elements recur among distinct
or remote peoples in the same combination, whereas on the basis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
of mere accident it could be expected that the several elements
would at times combine and at other times crop out separately,
one can be reasonably sure of the real identity and common
origin of the complex trait. When a trait is simple, it is more
difficult to be positive that the apparent resemblance amounts
to identity. Such doubt applies for instance to isolated magical
practices. A custom found among separate nations, such as
sprinkling water to produce rain, may be the result of an importation
of the idea from one people to another. Or again it
may represent nothing more than a specific application of the
assumed principle that an act similar to a desired effect will
produce that effect. This magical belief is so broad, and so
ramifying in its exemplifications, as to become almost impossible
to use as a criterion. The essential basis of magic may conceivably
have been developed at a single culture center in the
far distant past and have been disseminated thence over the
whole world. Or again, for all that it is possible to prove, magic
beliefs may really be rooted instinctively in the human mind
and grow thence over and over again with inevitability. There
seems no present way of determining which interpretation is
correct.</p>

<h3 id="section93">93. <span class="smcap">Flood Legends</span></h3>

<p>This situation applies to many widely spread concepts in
folk-lore. Flood myths of some sort, for instance, are told by
probably the majority of human nations. In the early days of
the science, this wide distribution of flood myths was held to
prove the actuality of a flood, or to be evidence of the descent
of all mankind from a single nation which had once really
experienced it. Such explanations are too obviously naïve to
require refutation to-day. Yet it is difficult to interpret the
wide prevalence of flood myths, either as spontaneous growth
from out the human mind, or as diffusion from a single devising
of the idea. Much of the difficulty is caused by the fact that
one cannot be sure that the various flood myths are identical.
Some peoples have the flood come after the earth is formed and
inhabited, and have it almost destroy the human race. Other
nations begin their cosmology with a flood. For them, water<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
was in existence before there was an earth, and the problem for
the gods or creative animals was to make the world. This,
according to some American Indian versions, they finally accomplished
by having one of their number dive to the bottom and
bring up a few grains of sand which were then expanded to
constitute terra firma. The first type of story is evidently a
true “flood” myth; the second might better be described as a
concept of “primeval water.” The difficulty is enhanced by the
fact that the two types are sometimes found amalgamated in
a single mythology. Thus the Hebrew account begins with the
primeval waters but subsequent to the formation of the earth
the deluge covers it. So, according to some American tribes, the
flood came after the earth, but the waters remained until after
the diving. It is clear that flood stories are more shifting than
the Magic Flight episode. They may conceivably all be variations
of a single theme which has gradually come to differentiate
greatly. But again, several distinct concepts—primeval
water, flood, the diving animals, the ark—may have been evolved
in different parts of the world, each developing in its own way,
and traveling so far, in some cases, as to meet and blend with
others. This last interpretation is favored by some of the facts
of distribution: the prevalence of the diving concept in America,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
for instance, and the absence of flood myths from much of
Africa.</p>

</figure>

<p>There is a vast amount of folk-lore recorded, and much of
it has lent itself admirably to the working out of its historical
origins, so far as limited regions are concerned. Folk-lorists
are often able to prove that one tale originated in India and
was carried into mediæval Europe, or that another was probably
first devised on the coast of British Columbia and then disseminated
across the Rocky mountains to the interior tribes of Indians.
When it comes to intercontinental and world-wide distribution,
however, difficulties of the sort just set forth in regard
to flood myths become stronger and stronger. While the most
interesting mythical ideas are those which are world-wide, it is
in these that uncertainty between origin by diffusion or parallelism
is greatest. The Magic Flight therefore constitutes a
grateful exception. It opens the door to a hope that more
assiduous analysis and comparison may lead to the accurate
determination of the source and history of other common and
fundamental myths.</p>

<h3 id="section94">94. <span class="smcap">The Double-headed Eagle</span></h3>

<p>An unexpected story of wandering attaches to the figure or
symbol of the double-headed eagle. Like many other elements
of civilization, this goes back to an Egyptian beginning. One
of the great gods of Egypt was the sun. The hawk and vulture
were also divine animals. A combination was made showing the
disk of the sun with a long narrow wing on each side. Or the
bird itself was depicted with outstretched wings but its body
consisting of the sun disk. These were striking figures of considerable
æsthetic and imaginative appeal. From Egypt the
design was carried in the second millenium B.C. to the Assyrians
of Mesopotamia and to the Hittites of Asia Minor. A second
head was added, perhaps to complete the symmetry of the figure.
Just as a wing and a foot went out from each side of the body
or disk, so now there was a head facing each way. This double-headed
bird symbol was carved on cliffs in Asia Minor. Here
the pictures remained, no doubt wondered at but uncopied, for
two thousand years. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
after Christ, the Turkish princes, feeling the symbol to be a fit
emblem of sovereignty, began stamping it on their coins. The
later Crusaders brought these coins, or the idea of the pattern,
back with them to Europe, where the mediæval art of heraldry
was flourishing. The double-headed eagle was a welcome addition
to the lions and griffins with which artists were emblazoning
the coats of arms of the feudal nobility. The meaning of sovereignty
remaining attached to the figure, the device before long
became indicative of the imperial idea. This is the origin of its
use as a symbol in the late empires of Austro-Hungary and
Russia.</p>

<p>Four hundred years ago Charles V was king of Spain and
Austria and Holy Roman emperor of Germany. It was in his
reign that Cortez and Pizarro conquered Mexico and Peru.
Thus the symbol of the double-headed eagle was carried into
the New World and the Indians became conversant with it.
Even some of the wilder tribes learned the figure, although they
were perhaps more impressed with it as a decorative motive than
as an emblem. At any rate, they introduced it into their textiles
and embroideries. The Huichol in the remote mountains
of Mexico, who use the design thus, seem to believe that their
ancestors had always been conversant with the figure. But such
a belief of course proves no more than did the ignorance of
European heraldists of the fact that their double-headed eagle
came to them from Asia Minor and ultimately from Egypt. No
pre-Columbian representation of the two-headed eagle is known
from Mexico. The conclusion can therefore hardly be escaped
that this apparently indigenous textile pattern of the modern
Huichol is also to be derived from its far source in ancient Egypt
of whose existence they have never heard.</p>

<h3 id="section95">95. <span class="smcap">The Zodiac</span></h3>

<p>The foregoing example should not establish the impression
that the main source of all culture is to be sought in Egypt.
Many other ancient and modern countries have made their contribution.
It is to the Chinese, for instance, that we owe silk,
porcelain, and gun powder. The ancient Sumerians and Babylonians,
on the lower course of the Tigris and Euphrates, moved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
toward definite cultural progress about as early as the Egyptians,
and have perhaps contributed as many elements to the
civilization of to-day.</p>

<p>One of these is the zodiac. This is the concept of dividing
the path of the sun, moon, and planets around the heavens into
twelve equal parts, each named after a constellation. The series
runs: ram, bull, twins, crab, lion, virgin, scales, scorpion, archer,
goat, water-carrier, fishes. Constellations, indeed, had begun to
be named at a very early time, as is clear from the practice
being common to all mankind. But the specific arrangement
of these twelve constellations as a measure of the movement of
the heavenly bodies seems to have made its first appearance
among the Chaldæan Babylonians about a thousand years before
Christ. From them the Persians, and then the Greeks, learned
the zodiac; and with its introduction to the Roman Empire it
became part of the fund of knowledge common to the whole of
western civilization. It does not appear to have been accepted
by the Egyptians until Roman imperial times. Knowledge of
the zodiac also spread eastward to India. It seems to have been
carried as far as China by Buddhist missionaries, but failed to
be seriously adopted in that country until its reintroduction by
Jesuit missionaries in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>The Chinese long before had invented a series of twelve signs
which has sometimes been called a zodiac, and gradually transmitted
it to the adjacent natives of Japan, Korea, Mongolia,
Turkistan, and Tibet. This seems to be of independent origin
from the western or Babylonian zodiac. It appears to have been
devised to designate the hours, then applied to other periods of
time, and finally to the heavens. Its path through the sky is
the reverse of the western zodiac; and its signs are specifically
different: rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, serpent, horse, sheep,
monkey, hen, dog, and pig. At most, therefore, it would seem
that there might have penetrated to China from the west the
idea of dividing time or space into twelve units and assigning
to each of these the name of an animal. The working out and
utilization of the idea were native Chinese.</p>

<p>Already in ancient times the pictures of the twelve constellations
of the western zodiac began to be abbreviated and reduced
to symbols. These gradually become more and more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
conventional, although evidences of their origin are still visible.
The sign of the ram, for instance, as we employ it in almanacs,
shows the downward curling horns of this animal; that for the
ox, his rising horns; for the archer, his arrow, and so on. These
cursive symbols, once they became fixed, underwent some travels
of their own which carried them to unexpected places. The
Negroes of the west coast of Africa make gold finger rings ornamented
with the twelve zodiacal symbols in their proper sequence.
They seem ignorant of the meaning, in fact do not
possess sufficient astronomical knowledge to be able to understand
the use of the signs. It also remains uncertain whether
they learned the set of symbols from European navigators or
from the Arabs that have penetrated the northern half of Africa.
Nevertheless it is the true zodiac which they portray, even
though only as a decorative pattern.</p>

<p>There has been some assertion that the zodiac was known to
the more advanced Middle American Indians between Arizona
and Peru, but the claim has also been denied. There does appear
to have been at least one series of animal signs used by the
Mayas of Yucatan in an astronomical connection. It is not
known that this series served the true zodiacal function of
noting the positions of the heavenly bodies. Further, the Maya
series consists of thirteen instead of twelve symbols, and the
figures present only distant resemblances to the Old World
zodiac. There is only one that is the same as in the Old World
zodiac: the scorpion. The relationship of the Maya and Old
World series is therefore unproved, and probably fictitious. The
case however possesses theoretical interest in that it illustrates
the criteria of the determination of culture relationships.</p>

<p>The Mexican zodiac would unquestionably be interpreted as
a derivative from the Asiatic one, even though its symbols departed
somewhat from those of the latter, provided that the
similar symbols came in the same order. The Asiatic ram might
well be replaced by a Mexican deer, the lion by a wildcat, and
the virgin by a maize goddess. And if the deer, the wildcat, and
the maize goddess came in first, fifth, and sixth place, it would
be almost compulsory to look upon them as superficially altered
equivalents of the Old World ram, lion, and virgin. It is conceivable
enough that similar individual symbols might independently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
come into use in remote parts of the world. But it is
practically impossible that a series of symbols should be put
into the same arbitrary sequence independently. As a mere
matter of mathematical probability there would be no more than
an infinitesimal chance of such a complex coincidence. If therefore
the sequential identity of the American series and the Old
World zodiac should ever be proved,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> it would be necessary to
believe that this culture element was somehow carried into the
Middle American regions from Asia, either across northern
America or across the Pacific.</p>

<p>Identity of sequence failing, there might still remain an instance
of partial convergence. It is within the range of possibility
that the Mayas, who were painstaking astronomers and
calculators, and who like ourselves named the stars and constellations
after animals, arranged a series of these as a mnemonic
or figurative aid in their calendrical reckoning. This, however,
would be a case of only incomplete parallelism. The general
concept would in that event have been developed independently,
its specific working out remaining distinctive.</p>

<p>On accurate analysis of culture phenomena, this sort of result
proves to be fairly frequent. When independent developments
have occurred, there is a basic or psychological similarity, but
concrete details are markedly different. On the other hand if
a differentiation from a common source has taken place, so that
true historical connection exists, some specific identity of detail
almost always remains as evidence. It therefore follows that if
only it is possible to get the facts fully enough, there is no
theoretical reason why ultimately all cultural phenomena that
are still hovering doubtfully between the parallelistic and the
diffusionary interpretations should not be positively explainable
one way or the other. This of course is not an assertion that
such proof has been brought. In fact there are far more traits
of civilization whose history remains to be elucidated than have
yet been solved. But the attainments already achieved, and an
understanding of the principles by which they have been made,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
encourage hope for an indefinite increase of knowledge regarding
the origin and growth of the whole of human culture.</p>

<h3 id="section96">96. <span class="smcap">Measures</span></h3>

<p>Another increment of civilization due to the Babylonians is
a series of metric standardizations. These include the division
of the circle into three hundred and sixty degrees, of the day
into twenty-four (originally twelve) hours, of the hour into
sixty minutes, of the foot into twelve inches, and the pound—as
it survives in our troy weight—into twelve ounces. It is
apparent that the system involved in these measures is based on
the number twelve and its multiple sixty. The weights current
in the ancient Near East also increased by sixties. On these
weights were based the ancient money values. The Greek mina,
Hebrew maneh, approximately a pound, comprised sixty shekels
(or a hundred Athenian drachmas), and sixty minas made a
talent. A talent of silver and one of gold possessed different
values, but the weight was the same. This system the Greeks
derived from Asia Minor and Phœnicia. Their borrowing of the
names, as well as the close correspondence of the actual weight
of the units, evidences their origin in Babylonia or adjacent
Aramæa.</p>

<p>The duodecimal method of reckoning was carried west, became
deeply ingrained during the Roman Empire, and has carried
down through the Middle Ages to modern times. It would
be going too far to say that every division of units of measure
into twelve parts can be traced directly to Babylonia. Now
and then new standards were arbitrarily fixed and new names
given them. But even when this occurred, the old habit of reckoning
by twelves for which the Babylonians were responsible,
was likely to reassert itself in competition with the decimal
system. Modern coinage systems have become prevailingly
decimal, but it is only a short time ago that in south Germany
60 kreuzer still made a gulden; and the twelve pence of the
English shilling obviously suggest themselves.</p>

<p>Certain of these metric units became fixed more than two
thousand years ago and have descended to us by an unbroken
tradition. The Babylonian degrees, minutes, and seconds, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
instance, became an integral part of the ancient astronomy, were
taken up by the Greeks, incorporated by them in their development
of the system of astronomy known as the Ptolemaic, and
thus became a part of Roman, Arab, and mediæval European
science. When a few centuries ago, beginning with the introduction
of the Copernican point of view, astronomy launched
forward into a new period of progress, the old system of reckoning
was so deeply rooted that it was continued without protest.
Had the first truly scientific beginnings of astronomy
taken place as late as those of chemistry, it is extremely doubtful
whether we should now be reckoning 360 degrees in the circumference
of the circle. The decimal system would almost certainly
have been applied.</p>

<p>The last few examples may give the impression that cultural
diffusion takes place largely in regard to names and numbers.
They may arouse the suspicion that the intrinsic elements of
inventions and accomplishments are less readily spread. This
is not the case. In fact it has happened time and again in the
history of civilization that the substance of an art or a knowledge
has passed from one people to another, while an entirely
new designation for the acquisition has been coined by the receiving
people. The English names of the seven days of the
week (§ <a href="#section125">125</a>) are a case in point. If stress seems to have been
laid here on names and numbers, it is not because they are more
inclined to diffusion, or most important, but because their diffusion
is more easily traced. They often provide an infallible
index of historical connection when a deficiency of historical
records would make it difficult, perhaps impossible, to prove
that the common possession of the thing itself went back to a
single source. If historical records are silent, as they are only
too often, on the origin of a device among a people, the occurrence
of the same device at an earlier time among another people
may strongly suggest that it was transmitted from these. But
the indication is far from constituting a proof because of the
theoretical possibility that the later nation might have made the
invention independently. It is chiefly when the device is complex
and the relation of its parts identical that the probability
of diffusion approaches surety. If however not only the thing
but its name also are shared by distinct nations, doubt is removed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
It is obvious that peoples speaking unrelated languages
will not coincide one time in a thousand in using the same name
for the same idea independently of each other. The play of
accident is thus precluded in such cases and a connection by
transmission is established. In fact the name is the better
touchstone. An invention may be borrowed and be given a
home-made name. But a foreign name would scarcely be adopted
without the object being also accepted.</p>

<h3 id="section97">97. <span class="smcap">Divination</span></h3>

<p>One other Babylonian invention may be cited on account of its
curious history. This is the pseudo-science of predicting the
outcome of events by examination of the liver of animals sacrificed
to the gods. A system of such divination, known as
hepatoscopy, was worked out by the Babylonian priests perhaps
by 2,000 B.C. Their rules are known from the discovery of
ancient clay models of the liver with its several lobes, each part
being inscribed with its significance according as it might bear
such and such appearance. In some way which is not yet wholly
understood, this system was carried, like the true arch, from the
Babylonians to the Etruscans. As there are definite ancient
traditions which brought the Etruscans into Italy from Asia,
the gap is however lessened. The Etruscans, who were evidently
addicted to priestly magic, carried on this liver divination
alongside another method, that of haruspicy or foretelling
from the flight or actions of birds. Both systems were learned
from them by the Romans, according to Roman tradition itself.</p>

<p>With the spread of Christianity, hepatoscopy and haruspicy
died out in the west. But meanwhile they had been carried in
the opposite direction from their Babylonian source of origin,
and became established in eastern Asia and finally, in somewhat
modified form, among remote uncivilized peoples. The pagan
priests of Borneo and the Philippines even to-day are foretelling
the future by observing the flight of birds and examining the
gall bladder—an organ intimately associated with the liver—of
sacrificial animals. If these primitive Malaysian peoples had
always remained uninfluenced by higher cultures, their divinatory
customs might be imputed to independent invention. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
live, however, at no great distance from the Asiatic mainland,
and are known to have been subjected to heavy cultural influences
from China, Arabia, and especially India. Four centuries
ago, to cite only a few specific instances, the Philippine
chieftains went under the title of rajah, the Hindu word for
king. In the southern Philippine islands there are “sultans”
to-day. In all parts of the Philippines as well as Borneo, even
among the rude tribes of the interior mountains, Chinese jars
imported centuries ago are treasured as precious heirlooms.
With these streams of higher culture flowing into the Malaysian
islands, the only reasonable conclusion is that the arts of liver
and bird divination were also imported. In fact, it seems probable
that the broader custom of sacrificing animals to the gods
and spirits, a custom to which the pagan Malaysians still adhere,
is a part of the same wave of influence from the Orient which
has so deeply stamped the Homeric poems and the Old Testament.
Although theoretically it is not surprising that hepatoscopy
and haruspicy still flourish among some backward and
marginally situated peoples, yet, in the concrete and at first
blush, it is striking to find that an institution which was active
in Babylonia three or four thousand years ago should still maintain
an unbroken life in Borneo. Evidently the diffusion principle
reaches far and long.</p>

<p>Another method of foretelling, which has spread equally far,
although its flow has been mainly from the east westward, is
scapulimancy, divination from the cracks that develop in
scorched shoulder blades. This seems to have originated in
ancient China with the heating of tortoise shells; had spread
by the third century after Christ to Japan, where deer shoulder
blades were employed; and is found to-day among the Koryak
and Chukchi of northeasternmost Siberia, who utilize the same
bones from seals and reindeer respectively. Elsewhere domestic
animals, above all the sheep, furnish the proper shoulder blade.
All the central Asiatic nations as far south as the Tibetans and
Lolos are addicted to the custom, which had official status with
the Mongol rulers in the thirteenth century, but must have been
older, since it was in vogue among the Byzantine Greeks two
hundred years earlier. The practice spread over practically all
Europe, where it flourished in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
and still lingers among belated rural populations; to
Morocco and perhaps other parts of north Africa; and in Asia
to South Arabia, Afghanistan, and westernmost India. Scapulimancy
was not known to the ancient Babylonians, Egyptians,
Hebrews, Greeks, Etruscans, and Romans; it seems not to have
penetrated far into India and not at all into the countries and
islands to the east of India, which are sheepless regions; and
it did not obtain a foothold in North America, where sheep and
other tame animals were also not kept. It appears therefore
that the custom, after a period of somewhat wavering formation
in eastern Asia, crystallized into an association with the
domesticated sheep, forming a true culture “complex,” and was
then diffused almost as far as this animal.</p>

<h3 id="section98">98. <i>Tobacco</i></h3>

<p>The speed with which inventions sometimes diffuse over large
areas is in marked contrast to the slowness with which they
travel on other occasions. The art or habit of smoking originated
in tropical America where the tobacco plant is indigenous.
From this middle region the custom spread, like agriculture,
pottery, and weaving, in both directions over most of north and
south America. Originally, it would seem, a tobacco leaf was
either rolled on itself to form a rude cigar, or was stuffed,
cigarette fashion, into a reed or piece of cane. Columbus found
the West Indians puffing at cigars. In the Southwestern United
States, the natives smoked from hollow reeds. Farther into the
United States, both to the east and west, the reed had become
a manufactured tube of wood or stone or pottery. This tubular
pipe, something like a magnified cigarette holder, has the bowl
enlarged at one end to receive the tobacco. It has to be held
more or less vertically. This form has survived to the present
day among the California Indians. As the tubular pipe spread
into the central and eastern United States, it was elaborated.
The bowl was made to rise from the top of the pipe, instead of
merely forming its end. This proved a convenience, for the pipe
had now no longer to be pointed skyward to be smoked. Here
then was a pipe with a definite bowl; but its derivation from the
straight tubular pipe is shown by the fact that the bowl was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
most frequently set not at the end of the stem, as we “automatically”
think a pipe should be, but near its middle. The
bowl evidently represented a secondary addition which there
seemed no more reason to place at the end than in the middle
of the pipe; and the latter happened to become the fashion.</p>

<p>All this evolution took place at least a thousand years ago,
probably much longer. Elaborate stone pipes have been discovered
in the earthworks left by the Mound Builders of the Ohio
Valley, a people whose very existence had been forgotten when
the whites first came. Californian stone pipes occur well down
toward the bottom of shell mounds estimated to have required
three or four thousand years to accumulate.</p>

<p>Here and there this slow diffusion suffered checks. In the
Andean region of South America tobacco came into competition
with coca, a plant whose leaf was chewed. The effect of the
contained alkaloid is to prevent fatigue and hunger. Of the
two, coca triumphed over tobacco, possibly because its action is
more drug-like. In North America, on the other hand, tribes
that had not adopted maize and bean agriculture, sometimes
tilled tobacco patches. With them, tobacco cultivation had outstripped
the spread of so important an institution as food agriculture.
In the extreme parts of North America, climatic factors
checked the growth of tobacco, either wild or cultivated. Where
the supply was scarce, it was either diluted with pulverized tree
bark, as by many tribes of the central United States, or it was
eaten, as by a number of groups on the Pacific coast. To these
latter, tobacco seemed too precious to set fire to and lightly puff
away. They mixed it with lime from burnt shells and swallowed
it. Taken in this form, a small quantity produces a powerful
effect. In the farthest north of the continent, even this
device had not obtained a foothold. The development of intertribal
trade was too slender and intermittent for anything but
valuables, let alone an article of daily consumption, to be transported
over long distances. The result was that the Eskimo,
when first discovered, knew nothing of tobacco or pipes.</p>

<p>The use of tobacco was quickly carried to the Old World
by the Spaniards, and before long all Europe was smoking.
Throughout that continent, irrespective of language, the plant
is known by modifications of the Spanish name <i>tabaco</i>, which in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
turn seems based on a native American name for cigar. By
the Spaniards and Portuguese, and later also by the Arabs, the
habit of smoking was carried to various points on the shores of
Africa, Asia, and the East Indies. Thence it spread inland.
Native African tribes, and others in New Guinea, who had never
seen a white man, have been found not only growing and smoking
tobacco, but firmly believing that their ancestors from time
immemorial had done so. This is a characteristic illustration of
the short-livedness of group memory and the unreliability of
oral tradition.</p>

<p>In northeastern Siberia, where the Russians introduced tobacco,
a special form of pipe came into use. It has a narrow
bowl flaring at the top. Seen from above, this bowl looks like
a disk with a rather small hole in the center. In profile it is
almost like a capital T. It is set on the end of the pipe-stem.
This stem may be straight or flattened and curved. This form
of pipe, along with tobacco as a trade article, crossed Behring
Strait and was taken up by the Alaska Eskimo. That this pipe
is not of Eskimo origin is shown by its close resemblance to the
Chukchi pipe of Siberia. The fact that it is impossible for
the Eskimo to grow tobacco corroborates the late introduction,
as does the Alaska Eskimo name: tawak. In short, smoking
reached the Eskimo only after having made the round of the
globe. Originating in Middle America, the custom spread very
anciently to its farthest native limits without being able to
penetrate to the Eskimo. As soon as the Spaniards appeared
on the scene, the custom started on a fresh career of travel and
rolled rapidly eastward about the globe until it reëntered
America in the hitherto non-smoking region of Alaska.</p>

<p>A second invasion of America by a non-American form of
pipe occurred in the eastern United States. The old pipe of this
region, as already stated, had its bowl set well back from the
end of the stem. The whole object thus had nearly the shape
of an inverted capital T, whereas the European pipe might be
compared to an L laid on its back. After the English settlers
had become established on the Atlantic coast, a tomahawk pipe
was introduced by them for trade purposes. This was a metal
hatchet with the butt of the blade hollowed out into a bowl
which connected with a bore running through the handle. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
end of the blade served to chop, the other to smoke. The hatchet
handle was also the pipe stem. The combination implement
could be used as a weapon in war and as a symbol of peace in
council. This doubleness of purpose caused it to appeal to the
Indian. The heads of these iron tomahawk pipes were made
in England for the Indian trade. They became so popular that
those natives who were out of reach of established traders, or
who were too poor to buy the metal hatchet-pipes, began to
imitate them in the stone which their forefathers had used. In
the Missouri valley, a generation ago, among tribes like the
Sioux and the Blackfeet, imitation tomahawk pipes, which would
never have withstood usage as hatchets, were being made of red
catlinite together with the standard, native, inverted-T pipes.
One of the two coexisting forms represented a form indigenous
to the region since a thousand years or more, the other an innovation
developed in Europe as the result of the discovery of
America and then reintroduced among the aborigines. Diffusion
sometimes follows unexpectedly winding routes.</p>

<h3 id="section99">99. <span class="smcap">Migrations</span></h3>

<p>It may seem strange that with all the reference to diffusion
in the foregoing pages, there has been so little mention of migration.
The reason is that migrations of peoples are a special and
not the normal means of culture spread. They form the crass
instances of the process, easily conceived by a simple mind. That
a custom travels as a people travels with it, is something that
a child can understand. The danger is in stopping thought
there and invoking a national migration for every important
culture diffusion, whereas it is plain that most culture changes
have occurred through subtler and more gradual operations.
The Mongols overran vast areas of Asia and Europe without
seriously modifying the civilization of those tracts. The accretions
that most influenced them, such as writing and Buddhism,
came to them by the quieter and more pervasive process of
peaceful penetration, in which but few individuals were active.
We are all aware that printing and the steam engine, the doctrine
of evolution and the habit of riming verses, have spread
through western civilization without conquests or migrations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
and that each year’s fashions flow out from Paris in the same
way. When however it is a question of something remote, like
the origin of Chinese civilization, it is only necessary for it to
be pointed out that the early forms of Chinese culture bear
certain resemblances to the early culture of Mesopotamia, and
we are sure to have some one producing a theory that marches
the Chinese out of the west with their culture packed away in
little bundles on their backs. That is far more picturesque, of
course, more appealing to the emotions, than to conceive of a
slow, gradual transfusion stretching over a thousand years. In
proportion as the known facts are few, imagination soars unchecked.
It is not because migrations of large bodies of men
are rare or wholly negligible in their influence on civilization
that they have been touched so lightly here, but because we all
tend, through the romantic and sensationalistic streak in us, to
think more largely in terms of them than the sober truth warrants.
It is in culture-history as in geology: the occasional
eruptions, quakings, and other cataclysms stir the mind, but the
work of change is mainly accomplished by quieter processes,
going on unceasingly, and often almost imperceptible until their
results accumulate.</p>

<h3 id="section100">100. <span class="smcap">General Observations</span></h3>

<p>The principle of truly independent or convergent invention is
more difficult to establish by positive examples than imitative
diffusion. It has often been assumed as operative, more rarely
proved; and even in the latter cases has perhaps never been
found to lead to complete identity.</p>

<p>In fact, the first observation to be made is that resemblance
must not be too close if independent development is to be the
explanation. A complex device used in two or more parts of
the world suggests a connection between them in very proportion
to its complexity. A combination of two or even three elements
might conceivably have been repeated independently. A combination
of five or ten parts serving an identical purpose in an
identical manner must necessarily appeal as impossible of having
been hit upon more than once. One thinks almost under compulsion,
in such a case, of historical connection, of a transference
of the idea or machine from one people to the other.</p>

<p>If the resemblance includes any inessential or arbitrary
parts, such as an ornament, a proportion that so far as utility
is concerned might be considerably varied but is not, a randomly
chosen number, or a name, the possibility of independent
development is wholly ruled out. Such extrinsic features would
not recur together once in a million times. Their association
forces a presumption of common origin, even though it be difficult
to account for the historical connection involved. The
significance of names in this situation has already been commented
on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>There is nothing arbitrary about this limitation on the parallelistic
principle. We all apply similar checks in practical life.
If in a court of law several witnesses testify to the same facts
in the same language, without one of them adding or diminishing
an item, if they follow the identical order of events, if even
details such as the precise minute of an occurrence are stated
without variation, judge and jury will infallibly suspect that the
several testimonies go back to a single source of inspiration.
Eyewitnesses will differ. They have seen from different angles;
have followed events with attention that varied according to
their participation and their previous habits and training; have
reacted with individually colored emotion. So with nations.
Their customs, interests, faculties are never wholly alike. Their
independent inventions and innovations, always springing out
of a distinctive soil, therefore necessarily take on a distinctive
aspect even when they embody the same idea. In the degree that
the form as well as the substance of culture traits coincide, does
the probability of independent evolution diminish in favor of
some sort of connection.</p>

<h3 id="section101">101. <span class="smcap">Cultural Context</span></h3>

<p>The presence or absence of other connections is also a factor
of greatest importance. In other words, no fact relating to
human civilization may be judged wholly without reference to
its context or background. If there are known connections,
either in space or in time, between two nations, the likelihood
of their having separately evolved a common trait is much less
than as between two peoples in different continents or separated
by thousands of years. It is not known precisely how knowledge
of the true arch and of liver divination were carried from
ancient western Asia to the Etruscans of Italy. Yet the fact
that Babylonia and Etruria shared two such specific culture
traits as these, greatly increases the probability for each one
having been borrowed from the Asiatic by the European people.
When the consideration is added that the ancients had traditions
of the Etruscans having come to Italy out of Asia Minor, the
likelihood of diffusion is strengthened to the point of practical
certainty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>Connection in space is a particularly cogent argument in
favor of diffusion, because of its powerful presumption of accompanying
communication. When several hundred Indian
tribes without a break in their ranks between Quebec and
Argentina cultivate maize, it would be absurd to dream of each
of them having originated the domestication of the plant for
itself. To be sure, it is logically conceivable that maize agriculture
was independently developed by two or three of the most
advanced tribes of the hundreds and then became diffused until
the two or three areas of dispersion met and coalesced into one
greater area. Yet the principle that economy of explanation
is the best would militate even against this interpretation as
compared with diffusion from a single center, unless there were
definite indications in favor of the multiple origin explanation.
Such indications might be radically distinct types of the plant
or of agricultural implements in several parts of the maize
area.</p>

<p>So, when the tribes on the Alaskan and Siberian sides of
Behring Sea relate similar Raven legends, the geographical
proximity is so close that it would be pedantic to let the fact
that two continents are involved stand in the way of an explanation
by diffusion. Even where the distribution of a trait penetrates
much farther into both America and Asia, as is true of
the composite bow (§ <a href="#section210">210</a>), the continuity of area leaves little
doubt as to diffusion from a single center, especially since it is
reinforced by other traits showing the same intercontinental
distribution: the Magic Flight story, for instance. It is only
when the areas are discrete as well as remote, when other similarities
between them are few or absent, when their cultural
backgrounds are radically dissimilar, as in the case of the
couvade, that parallelism begins to knock at the door of interpretation
with serious hope of admittance.</p>

<h3 id="section102">102. <span class="smcap">Universal Elements</span></h3>

<p>When a culture trait is very ancient and of practically world-wide
occurrence, it becomes difficult to estimate between diffusion
and independent invention. The fire-drill, flint chipping,
the bow and arrow, the doctrine of animism or belief in souls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
and spirits, sympathetic magic, are in this class. The very universality
of these elements tends to obliterate tangible evidence
as to their histories. A generation or two ago it was generally
taken for granted that such devices and beliefs as these sprang
more or less spontaneously out of the human mind as soon as
man had traversed a certain short distance of the evolutionary
road that led him away from the brutes. At present, anthropological
opinion is more cautious about such assumptions. It
is perhaps spontaneous enough for people in the habit of using
tools to try to fashion them from stone if other materials be
lacking, and easy for a nation accustomed to projectile weapons
to invent the bow without ever having learned of it. But this
is far from proving what a people without these habits might
do. Intelligent as an ape is, and gifted with manual dexterity,
it rarely enters his mind to throw a stone as a missile and never
to split it into a knife or weapon. For all we know, it may
have cost our ancestors untold mental energy to bring themselves
to the point of fashioning their first stone implements; so much,
indeed, that it is possible all of them did without until one more
gifted or fortunate group made the difficult invention which
was then imitated by the others. It is temptingly but fatally
easy to project our habits of mind into primitive man—much
easier to imagine ourselves in his position than to imagine him,
without reference to ourselves, as he was. Animal psychologists
have learned not to anthropomorphize, that is, endow the lower
animals with specifically human mind processes. Anthropologists
have learned to guard against the similar pitfall of interpreting
low cultures by the standards of our own, of assuming
that because a thing seems “natural” to us it must have seemed
natural and therefore have been done by any savage. It is clear
that what did not happen was for every tribe or race to originate
for itself its fire-making, flint-chipping, bows, animism, and
magic. It is conceivable that each of these culture products
traces back to a single source in human history. There are
authorities who have held this very opinion; some expressedly,
others by implication. It is not necessary to go so far; in fact,
wiser not to, because none of these matters is yet susceptible
of real proof. But it does seem profitable to recognize the possibility
of the truth of such views, and that the drift of accumulating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
knowledge and experienced interpretation is in their
direction.</p>

<p>A simple consideration which has too often been neglected is
that diffusion and imitation undisputedly do take place in culture
on a vast scale. So far as independent developments occur,
be that rarely or frequently, they are therefore sure to be more
or less intertwined with disseminations. Even one particular
device may be partly borrowed and partly modified or further
developed by original effort. Still more intimate must be the
combination of native and diffused elements in the whole culture
of any people. To wage an abstract battle as between two opposite
principles is sterile, when their manifestations are admittedly
frequent for one and at least certain for the other. It is
clearly more profitable to examine the associations and relations
of diffusion and convergence, the conditions under which they
supplement each other. Besides parallels springing up wholly
independently, there are two ways in which their relations to
diffusion may be conceived. An original single growth or wave
of diffusion may differentiate into local or temporal modifications,
which even after separation continue to develop along
parallel lines or reconverge. Or, on the other hand, independent
starts in similar direction may become merged in, or assimilated
by, a subsequent diffusion.</p>

<h3 id="section103">103. <span class="smcap">Secondary Parallelism in the Indo-European Languages</span></h3>

<p>Parallel growth secondary to a former unity and differentiation
is illustrated by the Indo-European languages. All the
known ancient forms of this speech family, Sanskrit, Avestan,
Greek, Latin, Gothic, were highly inflecting and compounding.
Their tendency was synthetic (§ <a href="#section51">51</a>, <a href="#section57">57</a>).</p>

<p>Grammatical ideas such as voice, tense, number, case, were
expressed by elements affixed to the word stem and incapable of
a separate existence. For <i>they will have loved</i> Latin says
<i>ama-v-eru-nt</i>. The <i>-v-</i> has the force of <i>have</i>, the <i>-eru-</i> of <i>will</i>,
<i>-nt</i> of <i>they</i>; but none of these parts can be used alone, as their
equivalents in English can be, or as in French <i>ils auront aimé</i>.
The two latter languages are analytical. They break an idea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
into parts which they express by separate words that change
form but little. They retain only fragments of conjugations and
declensions. Sanskrit had eight noun cases, Latin six; English
has only two, the subjective-objective and the possessive, and
French only one, or rather no case-form at all.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>This development toward a more analytical form is not only
traceable in several non-Indo-European speech families, such as
Chinese and Malayo-Polynesian (§ <a href="#section61">61</a>), but has gone on in all
the branches of Indo-European. It is visible in the growth of
English from Anglo-Saxon; of French, Spanish, and Italian
from Latin; of modern from ancient Persian; of Hindi and
Bengali from Sanskrit. True, some of these have been in contact,
like the Germanic and Latin languages, and might therefore
be imagined to have set one another an example, although
there is little evidence that languages seriously influence each
other’s forms. But many of the Indo-European idioms have not
been in contact at all for thousands of years. The Germanic
and the Indo-Iranic branches, for instance, must have separated
at least four thousand years ago. For the greater part of this
period, accordingly, the related but no longer communicating
languages that have resulted in modern English and Bengali,
to take only one instance, have independently driven toward the
same goal of more and more analytical structure. It may well
be that the hidden germ of this impulse lay implanted in the
common Indo-European mother-tongue at the time of its differentiation
five or more thousand years ago. But the movement
of its daughters has certainly been an astoundingly parallel
one.</p>

<h3 id="section104">104. <span class="smcap">Textile Patterns and Processes</span></h3>

<p>An analogous situation is provided by the similarity of diamond
shaped patterns woven in twilled baskets in parts of North
and South America, Asia and the East Indies, and Africa. This
looks like parallelism and is parallelism. But it is clearly a
secondary result of the twilling process, as this, in turn, flourishes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
most vigorously where woody monocotyledonous plants—cane,
bamboo, palms—are available to furnish hard, durable,
flat, pliable splints. The technique of the weave is such that if
materials of two colors are used, the characteristic patterns
evolve themselves almost of necessity. The twilling process may
have been invented independently in several of the regions addicted
to it, or have been devised only once in the world’s history.
It is too simple and too ancient a technique for modern knowledge
to choose between the alternatives with positiveness. Brazilian
and East Indian patterns are much more likely to have
been each developed on the spot, as derivatives from the more
fundamental and possibly transmitted twilling process.</p>

<p>The coiling technique for making baskets looks from its distribution
in Africa and about the Mediterranean, in northeast
Asia and northwest America, in the southern extremity of South
America, in Malaysia and Australia, as if it had originated
independently several times, and there is partial confirmation
in the fact that different varieties of coiling are typical of most
of the areas. If however further knowledge should connect the
now separate areas of coiling, the art would then have to be
regarded as probably due to diffusion from a single invention.
In that case, however, special varieties, such as half-hitch coiling
in Tierra del Fuego and Tasmania, and single-rod coiling
in the East Indies and California, would remain as instances
of secondary parallelism affecting particular aspects or parts
of the generic process.</p>

<p>A blending of diffusion and parallelism is apparent also in
other textile processes. The fundamentals, as embodied in simple
woven basketry, mats, and wiers, were probably carried into
America by the first immigrants. Weaving from suspended
warps and in an incomplete loom frame may possibly have been
similarly transmitted by diffusion or have been developed locally.
Thread spinning, however, the complete loom, and the heddle
were clearly devised in the middle region of America independently
of their invention in the Old World, as is evident from
their absence in the connecting areas of North America and
Siberia (§ <a href="#section187">187</a>, <a href="#section188">188</a>). But the treadle shed, the next step in the
Eastern hemisphere, was never invented in the Western, so that
at this point the parallelism ends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>Again, diffusion and convergence both enter into the history
of what is known as resist dyeing, that is, the covering of
portions of textile patterns before immersion into the dye.
Batik, when wax is used as the protecting medium, is one form
of resist dyeing. Another method is “to tie little bunches of
cloth with a cord either soaked in clay or wax or spun from
fiber which has no affinity for the colors and then dip the tied
web into the pot.” In the Old World, tie dyeing is of Asiatic,
probably of Indian origin, and was in use by the seventh century,
perhaps earlier. The Mohammedan conquests carried the
art to Malaysia on the one hand, to western Africa and Spain
on the other, whence it was transmitted to the Indians of Guatemala
after their subjugation by the Spaniards—like the double-headed
eagle. The Peruvians, however, had long before hit upon
the same art, as attested by textile remains in pre-Columbian
graves. Here then, we have a wide and long enduring diffusion
of the general resist dyeing process, and a locally limited instance
of independent parallelism for one phase of it.</p>

<h3 id="section105">105. <span class="smcap">Primary Parallelism: the Beginnings of Writing</span></h3>

<p>Primary parallelism can be established fairly frequently, but
usually only with reference to a general principle, the applications
of which invariably retain evidence of their original
separateness.</p>

<p>An illustration is furnished by the history of writing, as
sketched in the introductory paragraphs of the chapter on the
Alphabet (§ <a href="#section130">130-133</a>). Many nations have entered the simple
stage of pictography. Only a few are known to have gone on
to the stage of rebus or transitional writing—mixed pictograms
or ideograms and phonograms. Of these, certainly two and
possibly as many as four, five, or six devised their own rebus
systems: the Egyptians, Sumerians, Chinese, Hittites, Cretans,
and Mayas, in four continents. But here the parallel ceases.
The content of the systems, the signs themselves and their
sound values, are wholly different. The similarity applies only
to the principle of reading pictures or symbols for their pictureless
homonyms. The concrete application of this method has
nothing in common in the several parallel cases. Finally, complete<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
phonetic writing was invented but once, all alphabets, however
diverse, being historical descendants of the primitive Semitic
alphabet, which served as the sole source of a tremendous diffusion
(§ <a href="#section134">134-149</a>).</p>

<p>It is worth noting, however, that the first or pictographic stage
of writing is by no means a thing that flows instinctively from
all men. There are peoples, like some of the Indians of Brazil
and California, deficient in the ability or habit, according as
one may wish to term it, of expressing themselves in linear
representations. They do not draw rude outlines to depict objects.
Asked to do so, they profess inability, though set an
example, or make a pathetically crude attempt. Their failure
or refusal does not argue inherent lack of faculty, since the
children of the same races, when put to school, draw figures
with interest and often with success. The attitude of the adults
is rather that of a person who had never heard even a snatch
of music of any kind or seen an instrument, being taken to a
concert and then asked to compose a simple little song. He
would look upon this task as transcendently beyond his powers.
There are no songless nations, but there are pictureless ones.
Consequently picture-writing is not the spontaneous product
which we, who as children are reared in an environment of
pictures, might imagine it to be. If pictography were due to
a primary parallelism, to a spontaneous outflow of the human
mind, its absences would be in need of explanation. If, on the
other hand, it is the result of a single diffusing development,
this must have an antiquity of more than fifteen thousand
years, as attested by the Old Stone Age paintings, and the
failure of certain peoples to be affected is also in need of
explanation.</p>

<p>Another case of parallelism is the recurring tendency to write
syllabically instead of alphabetically. The Hindu inclination in
this direction is discussed below (§ <a href="#section146">146</a>). That the phonetic
symbols of rebus systems should be largely syllabic is small
wonder, for they are pictures of things named with whole words.
But the Hindu script was derived from a Semitic letter alphabet,
and its essentially syllabic nature thus represents a reversion.
The Japanese in adding 47 purely phonetic characters to the
Chinese ideograms in order to express grammatical elements,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
proper names, and the like in their speech, denoted a syllable
by each character. A third as many consonant and vowel signs
would have answered the same purpose. When Sequoya the
Cherokee devised an alphabet for his people in order to equate
them with the whites, he incorporated the forms of a number
of the English letters, but the values of all his signs were syllabic.
The same holds of the West African Vei writing invented
in the nineteenth century by a native. He had had enough
mission schooling to be stimulated by the idea of writing, but
“instinctively” fell back on syllable signs even though this
necessitated two hundred different characters.</p>

<p>There is an evident psychological reason for the uniformity
of these endeavors: we image words, in fact produce them, in
syllables, not in sounds. Any one, in slow speech, tends to syllabify,
whereas few wholly illiterate people can be induced without
patient training to utter the separate consonants and vowels
of a word, even for the purpose of teaching a foreigner.</p>

<p>This case of parallelism rests, therefore, on a psychological
fact of apperception. But it was the “accidents” of culture,
not innate psychology, that determined the particular symbols,
and their values, chosen by the Hindus, Japanese, Cherokee,
and Vei, with the result that in these symbols there is no specific
similarity.</p>

<h3 id="section106">106. <span class="smcap">Time Reckoning</span></h3>

<p>Still another case of primary parallelism is provided by the
Maya-Aztec system of time denotation by coupling two series
of symbols in an overlapping system of permutations, as described
below (§ <a href="#section197">197</a>). This is as if we denoted the successive
days of the year 1 January, 2 February, 3 March, and so on,
until, having come to 12 December we went on 13 January,
14 February, and so once more around until 31 July was
reached, when the next days would be 1 August and 2 September
instead of February 1 and 2. Cumbersome and strange
as this system appears, an exact parallel to it in principle was
devised by the Hellenistic philosophers when they coupled the
twenty-four hours of the day with the seven planets in a 168-hour
cycle which gave the order and names to the days of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
week (§ <a href="#section124">124</a>). A third case occurs in China where ten “celestial
stems” and twelve “terrestrial branches” were permutated to
form a sixty year chronological cycle.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> All three of these devices
are based on the same mathematical principle and serve the
same end of time reckoning. But their content and result is
different. The Greeks combined 24 with 7, the Chinese 12 with
10, the Mayas 13 with 20 and 260 with 365; and the periods
treated ranged from hours to years.</p>

<p>These cases of primary parallelism allow the inference that
there are certain inherent tendencies of the human mind in
certain directions, such as operation in rebus reading, syllabic
writing, reckoning by least common multiples. Here, then, is
a seeming approach for a definite psychological interpretation
of the history of civilization. Yet the results of such a method
of attack must not be overestimated. The generic manner of
culture in these several instances is indeed uniform enough to
permit the conclusion that it springs from a uniform impulse
or bent of the mind. But all the particular, concrete content
of these cultural manifestations is as diverse as their historical
origins are separate; which means that psychology may explain
what is psychological in the cases, but that a larger cultural
constituent remains over before which the generically valid principles
of psychology are ineffective as explanations. As in the
case of the influence of physical environment it might be said
that psychological factors provide the limiting conditions of
cultural phenomena.</p>

<h3 id="section107">107. <span class="smcap">Scale and Pitch of Pan’s Pipes</span></h3>

<p>A startling parallelism has been demonstrated between the
Pan’s pipes of the Solomon islands in Melanesia and those of
the northwest Brazilian Indians. The odd pipes differ, each
from the next, by the interval of a fourth. The even pipes give
notes half-way in pitch between the adjacent odd ones, and thus
form another “circle of fourths.” But the similarity does not
end here. The absolute pitch of the examined instruments from
Melanesia and Brazil is the same. Thus, the vibration rates in
successive pipes are 557 and 560.5; 651 and 651; 759 and 749;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
880 and 879! This is so close a coincidence as to seem at first
sight beyond the bounds of accidental convergence. The data
have in fact been offered, and in some quarters accepted, as
evidence of a historical connection between the western Pacific
and South America. Yet the connection would have had to be
ancient, since no memory of it remains nor is it supported by
resemblances in race, speech, nor anything obvious in culture.
The instruments are perishable. Primitive people, working by
rule of thumb, would be unable to produce an instrument of
given absolute pitch except by matching it against another, and
perhaps not then. Moreover, it is not known that absolute pitch
is of the least concern to them. It is therefore incredible that
this correspondence rests on any ancient diffusion: there must
be an error in the record somewhere, or the one accident in a
million has happened in the particular instruments examined.</p>

<p>The identity of scale or intervals however remains, and may
be a true case of parallelism. Only, as usual, it boils down to
a rather simple matter. The circles of fourths evidently originate
in the practice, in both regions, of overblowing the pipes.
This produces over-tones; of which the second, the “third partial
tone,” is the fifth above the octave of the fundamental, so that
successive notes in either the odd or even series of pipes, would,
on the octave being disallowed, differ by fourths. The basis
of the resemblance, then, is a physical law of sound. The cultural
similarity shrinks to the facts of pipes in series, the use
of overblown tones, and the intercalating odd-even series. Even
these resemblances are striking, and more specific than many
cited cases of parallelism. In fact, were they supported by
enough resemblances in other aspects of culture, they would go
far to compel belief in actual connections between Melanesia
and Brazil.</p>

<h3 id="section108">108. <span class="smcap">Bronze</span></h3>

<p>A striking case of independent development is offered by the
history of bronze. Bronze is copper alloyed with five to twenty
per cent of tin. The metals form a compound with properties
different from those of the two constituents. Tin is a soft metal,
yet bronze is harder than copper, and therefore superior for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
tools. Also, it melts at a lower temperature and expands in
solidifying from the molten condition, and thus is better material
for castings.</p>

<p>In the eastern hemisphere bronze was discovered early and
used widely. For nearly two thousand years it was the metal
par excellence of the more advanced nations. A Bronze Age,
beginning about 4,000 B.C., more or less simultaneously with
the first phonetic writing, is recognized as one of the great divisions
of cultural time (§ <a href="#section66">66</a>, <a href="#section225">225</a>).</p>

<p>In the western hemisphere bronze was apparently invented
later than in the eastern and spread less extensively. It was
discovered in or near the Bolivian highland, which is rich in
tin (§ <a href="#section196">196</a>). From there its use diffused to the Peruvian highland,
then to the coast, then north to about Ecuador, and finally,
perhaps by maritime contacts, to Mexico, where local deposits
of tin were probably made use of after their value was realized.</p>

<p>Theoretically, it might be queried whether knowledge of
bronze had possibly been carried to the Andes from the eastern
hemisphere by some now forgotten migration or culture transmission.
Against such a supposition there stands out first of
all the isolated and restricted distribution of the South American
bronze art. It is ten thousand miles by land from the metal-working
nations of Asia to the middle Andes. A people or
culture wave that had traveled so far could not but have left
traces of its course by the way. The utilitarian superiority of
bronze over stone tools is so great that no people that had once
learned the art would be likely to give it up. Even if here and
there a group of tribes had retrograded, it cannot be imagined
that all the nations between China and Peru could have slipped
back so decisively. Certainly peoples like the Mayas and
Chibchas, expert metallurgists, would never have abandoned
bronze-making.</p>

<p>The theory of a Chinese junk swept out of its course and
washed on a South American shore might be invoked. But the
original South American bronze culture occupies an inland
mountain area. Further, while Asiatic ships have repeatedly
been wrecked on the Pacific coast of North America and probably
at times also on that of South America, there is everything
to indicate that the civilizational effects of such accidents were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
practically nil. The highest cultures of Mexico and South
America were evolved in interior mountain valleys or plateaus.
Not one of the great accomplishments of the American race—architecture,
sculpture, mathematics, metallurgy—shows any
specific localization on the shore of the Pacific.</p>

<p>Further, it is hard to understand how the arrival of a handful
of helpless strangers could initiate an enduring culture
growth. It is easy enough for us, looking backward through the
vista of history, to fancy the lonely Indians standing on the
shore to welcome the strangers from the west, and then going
with docility to school to learn their superior accomplishments.
Actually, however, people normally do not feel or act in this
way. Nations are instinctively imbued with a feeling of superiority.
They look down upon the foreigner. Even where they
admit his skill in this matter or that, they envy rather than admire
him. Thus, there is historic record of Oriental and European
vessels being wrecked on the Pacific coast of North America,
during the last century and a half, among tribes that were still
almost wholly aboriginal. In no case did the natives make any
attempt to absorb the higher culture of the strangers. Generally
these were enslaved or killed, their property rifled; sometimes
the wreck was set on fire. The greed for immediate gain
of the treasures in sight proved stronger than any dim impulses
toward self-improvement by learning.</p>

<p>As one conservative author has put it, occasional visits of
Asiatics or Pacific islanders to the shores of America would be,
from the point of view of the growth of the vast mass of culture
in that continent, “mere incidents.” From the review given
below, in Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII">XIII</a>, it is clear that the main determinants
of American culture accumulation, after the first primitive start,
were internal; and the case seems as clear for metal working
as for any phase.</p>

<h3 id="section109">109. <span class="smcap">Zero</span></h3>

<p>One of the milestones of civilization is the number symbol
zero. This renders possible the unambiguous designation of
numbers of any size with a small stock of figures. It is the zero
that enables the symbol 1 to have the varying values of one, ten,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
hundred, or thousand. In our arithmetical notation, the symbol
itself and its position both count: 1,234 and 4,321 have different
values although they contain the identical symbols. Such a
system is impossible without a sign for nothingness: 123 and
1,023 would be indistinguishable. Our zero, along with the other
nine digits, appears to be an invention of the Hindus approximately
twelve or fifteen hundred years ago. We call the notation
“Arabic” because it was transmitted from India to Europe
by the Arabs.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure28" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure28.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span> Maya symbols for zero: <i>a</i>, monumental; <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, cursive.
(From Bowditch.)</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Without a zero sign and position values, two methods are open
for the representation of higher numerical values. More and
more signs can be added for the high values. This was done by
the Greeks and Romans. MV means 1,005, and only that. This
is simple enough; but 1,888 requires so cumbersome a denotation
as MDCCCLXXXVIII—thirteen figures of six different
kinds. A simple system of multiplying numbers expressed like
this one is impossible. The unwieldiness is due to the fact that
the Romans, not having hit upon the device of representing
nothingness, employed the separate signs I, X, C, M for the
quantities which we represent by the single symbol 1 with from
no to three zeroes added.</p>

<p>The other method is that followed by the Chinese. Besides
signs corresponding to our digits from 1 to 9, they developed
symbols corresponding to “ten times,” “hundred times,” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
so on. This was much as if we should use the asterisk, *, to
denote tens, the dagger, †, for hundreds, the paragraph, ¶, for
thousands. We could then represent 1,888 by 1 ¶ 8 † 8 * 8, and
1,005 by 1 ¶ 5, without any risk of being misunderstood. But
the writing of the numbers would in most cases require more
figures, and mathematical operations would be more awkward.</p>

<p>The only nation besides the Hindus to invent a zero sign and
the representation of number values by position of the basic
symbols, were the Mayas of Yucatan. Some forms of their zero
are shown in <a href="#figure28">Figure 28</a>. This Maya development constitutes an
indubitable parallel with the Hindu one. So far as the involved
logical principle is concerned, the two inventions are identical.
But again the concrete expressions of the principle are dissimilar.
The Maya zero does not in the least have the form of
our or the Hindus’ zero. Also, the Maya notation was vigesimal
where ours is decimal. They worked with twenty fundamental
digits instead of ten. Their “100” therefore stood for 400, their
“1,000” for 8,000.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Accordingly, when they wrote, in their
corresponding digits, 1,234, the value was not 1,234 but 8,864.
Obviously there can be no question of a common origin for such
a system and ours. They share an idea or a method, nothing
more. As a matter of fact, these two notational systems, like
all others, were preceded by numeral word counts. Our decimal
word count is based on operations with the fingers, that of the
Maya on operations with the fingers and toes. Twenty became
their first higher unit because twenty finished a person.</p>

<p>It is interesting that of the two inventions of zero, the Maya
one was the earlier. The arithmetical and calendrical system
of which it formed part was developed and in use by the time
of the birth of Christ. It may be older; it certainly required
time to develop. The Hindus may have possessed the prototypes
of our numerals as early as the second century after Christ,
but as yet without the zero, which was added during the sixth
or according to some authorities not until the ninth century.
This priority of the Maya must weaken the arguments sometimes
advanced that the ancient Americans derived their religion,
zodiac, art, or writing from Asia. If the zero was their
own product, why not the remainder of their progress also? The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
only recourse left the naïve migrationist would be to turn the
tables and explain Egyptian and Babylonian civilization as due
to a Maya invasion from Yucatan.</p>

<h3 id="section110">110. <span class="smcap">Exogamic Institutions</span></h3>

<p>In many parts of the world nations live under institutions by
which they are divided into hereditary social units that are
exogamous to one another. That is, all persons born in a unit
must take spouses born in some other unit, fellow members of
one’s unit being regarded as kinsmen. The units are generally
described as clans, gentes, or sibs; or, where there are only two,
as moieties. In many cases the sibs or moieties are totemic;
named after, or in some way associated with, an animal, plant,
or other distinctive object that serves as a badge or symbol of
the group. Often the association finds expression in magic or
myth. Since under this system one is born into his social unit,
cannot change it, and can belong to one only, it follows that
descent is unilateral. It is impossible for a man to be a member
of both his father’s and his mother’s sib or totem; custom has
established everywhere a rigid choice between them. Some tribes
follow descent from the mother or matrilinear reckoning, others
are patrilinear.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Institutions of this type have a wide and irregular distribution.
They are frequent in Australia, New Guinea, and Melanesia;
found in parts of the East Indies and southeastern Asia;
quite rare or stunted in the remainder of Asia and Polynesia;
fairly common in Africa, though they occur in scattered areas;
characteristic again of a large part of North America, but confined
to a few districts of South America. At a rough guess, it
might be said that about as many savage peoples, the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
over, possess totemic-exogamous clans or moieties as lack them.
The patchiness on the map of exogamic institutions argues
against their being all the result of a wave of culture transmission
emanating from a single source. Had such a diffusion occurred,
it should have left its marks among the numerous intervening
tribes that are sibless. Further, both in the eastern and
western hemispheres, the most primitive and backward tribes
are, with fair regularity, sibless and non-totemic. If therefore
a hypothetical totem-sib movement had encircled the planet, it
could not have been at an extremely ancient date, else the primitive
tribes would have been affected by it; and since records go
back five thousand years in parts of the Mediterranean area, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
movement, if relatively late, should have left some echo in history,
which it has not.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="figure29" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/figure29.jpg" alt=" ">

</figure>

<p>It is therefore probable that totem-sib institutions did not all
emanate from one origin, but developed independently several
times. The question then becomes, how often, and where?</p>

<p>The evidence for America has been reviewed in another connection
(§ <a href="#section185">185</a>). It can be summarized in the statement that
at least two of the three sib areas<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> of North America, and
probably the two principal ones of South America, seem to
have resulted from a single culture growth which perhaps centered
at one time, although subsequently superseded, in the
middle sector of the double continent. This movement may have
had first a patrilinear and then a matrilinear phase, though at
no great interval of time. The third North American area may
have got its patrilinear sib institutions from the same source
but probably developed its matrilinear ones locally as a subsequent
growth. If so, this would be an instance of convergence
on the same continent—a rather rare phenomenon.</p>

<p>For Australia, New Guinea, and Melanesia, the geographical
proximity is so close as to suggest a single origin for the whole
area. Patrilinear and matrilinear descent are both found in
Australia as well as Melanesia. This fact has been interpreted
as the result of an earlier patrilineal and a later matrilineal
phase of diffusion. It is interesting that this conclusion parallels
the tentative one independently arrived at for America, although
in both hemispheres further analysis and distributional study
must precede a positive verdict.</p>

<p>In the principal other sib area, Africa, the reckoning is so
prevailingly patrilineal, that the few cases of matrilineate can
scarcely be looked upon as anything but secondary local modifications.
As to whether the totemism and exogamy of Africa
can be genetically connected with those of Australia-Melanesia,
it is difficult to decide. The more conservative attitude would
be to regard them as separate growths, although so many cultural
similarities have been noted between western Africa and
the area that stretches from Indo-China to Melanesia, as to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
have raised suspicions of an actual connection (§ <a href="#section270">270</a>). Yet
even if these indications were to be confirmed, thus sweeping
most or all the Old World sib institutions into a single civilizational
movement, the distinctness of this from the parallel development
of the New World would remain.</p>

<p>It is significant that in the three successive continents of
America, Oceania, and Africa the patrilinear and matrilinear
phases of the sib type of society exist side by side, and that the
same duality even holds for each of the separate areas in
America. That is, the Northwest American sib area includes
matrilinear as well as patrilinear tribes; the Southwest area
includes both; and so on.</p>

<p>A similar tendency toward geographical association is found
in other phases of social structure: the clan and moiety, and
again totemism and exogamy.</p>

<p>The clan or multiple form of sib organization is logically distinct
from the moiety or dual form. Under the plural system,
a person, being of clan A, may marry at will into clans B, C,
D, E, F. Three of his four grandparents would normally be
of other clans than his own, but of which they were members,
would vary in each individual case. In a patrilineal society,
one member of clan A would have his maternal uncles of clan B;
the next, of clan C; a third, perhaps of clan F; according to
the choices which their fathers had made of wives.</p>

<p>Under the dual system, however, a member of moiety A may
just as well be regarded as having a wife of moiety B prescribed
or predestined for him as being forbidden an A wife. Two of
his grandparents, say his father’s father and his mother’s
mother, are inevitably of his own moiety, the two others of the
opposite one. Every possible kinsman—his maternal uncle, his
cross cousin, his father-in-law, his wife’s brother-in-law, his
daughter’s son—has his moiety affiliation foreordained. Where
descent is paternal, for instance, everybody knows that his
future mother-in-law must be of his own moiety. Evidently the
effect of this dual system on the relations between kinsfolk, on
social usages, on the individual’s attitude of mind toward other
individuals, should normally tend to be profoundly different
from the influence of a multiple clan system. On theoretical
grounds it might seem likely that the dual and multiple schemes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
had nothing to do with each other, that they sprang from distinct
psychological impulses.</p>

<p>Yet such a belief would be ungrounded, as the facts of distribution
promptly make clear. In every multiple sib area of
any moment, moieties also occur, and vice versa. In the California-Southwest
region, for instance, tribes like the Miwok are
divided into moieties only, the Mohave and Hopi into clans only,
the Tewa and Cahuilla into moieties subdivided into clans. So
in the Eastern, the Plains, and the Northwest areas of North
America, clan tribes and moiety tribes live side by side; whereas
as soon as these regions are left behind, there are vast districts—much
of Mexico, Texas, the Great Basin and Plateau, northern
Canada and the Arctic coast—whose inhabitants get along
without either clans or moieties. So again in Melanesia and in
Australia (<a href="#figure29">Fig. 29</a>), the two types of organization exist side by
side, while most of Polynesia, Asia, and Europe are void of
both. Only Africa shows some development of multiple clan
institutions but no moieties. In short, as soon as areas of some
size are considered, they prove in the main to be of two kinds.
Either they contain both clan tribes and moiety tribes, or they
contain neither. That is, the clan institution and the moiety
institution are correlated or associated in geography, as patrilinear
and matrilinear descent are correlated, which indicates a
community of origin for them.</p>

<p>A similar relation exists between exogamic units, be they
moieties or clans, and totemism. The first constitutes a scheme
of society, a method of organization; the second, a system of
symbolism. Sibs are social facts, totems a naming device with
magico-religious implications. There is no positive reason why
they should be associated. They are not always associated.
There are American tribes like the Navaho and Gros Ventre that
live under unilateral and exogamic institutions without totems.
Placenames or nicknames distinguish the groups. In Australia,
the Arunta possess unilaterally reckoning exogamic groups as
well as totems, but the two are dissociated; a person takes
his group by descent, his totem wholly irrespective of this
according to place of birth or conception. In Africa there are
no less than six tribes or series of tribes in which exogamy and
totemism are thus dissociated; a person takes his totem from his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
father, his exogamic unit from his mother, so that the two ordinarily
do not coincide for parent and child. Exogamy and
totemism, then, are theoretically separate factors.</p>

<p>Yet since they are distinct, it is remarkable that in probably
seven or eight tenths of all cases they coincide, and that in each
of the continents or areas containing them they are found associated.
If exogamy and totemism had grown out of separate
roots, one could expect at least one considerable area somewhere
in which one of them appeared without the other. But there
is no such area. Wherever social exogamy appears among a
larger group of nations, social totemism also crops out; and
vice versa.</p>

<p>It must then be concluded that exogamy and totemism, matrilineate
and patrilineate, multiple and dual sibs, all show a strong
tendency toward association with one another. In other words,
their correlation is positive and strong. Even where they seem
mutually exclusive in their very nature, like matrilinear and
patrilinear reckoning, ways have been found by unconscious
human ingenuity to make them coexist among one people, as
when one reckoning is attached to the exogamy, the other to
the totemism; and still more often they occur among adjacent
tribes.</p>

<h3 id="section111">111. <span class="smcap">Parallels and Psychology</span></h3>

<p>Such associations as these are common enough in the history
of civilization. A number are touched upon elsewhere in this
volume under the name of culture trait associations or complexes
(§ <a href="#section97">97</a>, <a href="#section149">149</a>). But usually such a complex or nexus consists
of culture elements that have no necessary connection:
Christianity and trousers, for instance. It is accident that first
throws them together; association ties them one to the other;
once the cluster is established by usage, its coherence tends to
persist. But there is something arbitrary about this cohesion,
generally. There is no inherent reason why a hundred American
tribes that grow maize should also grow beans and squashes
and nothing else; but they do limit themselves to the three.
The distinctive feature of the sib-complex is that it has an almost
reasonable quality. Its elements, however separate or even opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
logically, do have a certain psychological affinity to one
another. Also, the arbitrary maize-beans-squash complex and
other complexes are generally not duplicated. But the intricate
and psychologically founded totemism-exogamy-descent complex
looks as if it might have been triplicated or quadruplicated.
This parallelism, if the facts prove to substantiate it, is parallelism
raised to a higher power than any yet considered. Heretofore
the discussion has been of the parallelism of single culture
traits. Here it is a case of parallelism of a complex of
culture traits. Such complex convergence might suggest something
peculiar to or inherent in the human mind, leading it,
once it is stimulated to commence the development of one of the
factors of the complex, to follow with the production of the other
factors.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Similar instances would be the tendency of agriculture to be
followed by town life, if it could be demonstrated, though this
seems doubtful; of settled living to be accompanied by migration
legends; of religions with personal founders to become
propagandizing and international but in time to die out among
the nations in which they were originated.</p>

<p>In regard to all such cases it may be said first of all that an
exhaustive analysis is necessary to ascertain whether the seeming
association or correlation is borne out by the facts. Second,
the possibility of diffusion must be eliminated. If Melanesian
and African totem-exogamy are both products of one culture
growth, they cannot be counted as two examples of the same
association. If they should ultimately both prove to be linked
with the American system by a wave of migration or culture
contact, as has, indeed been maintained in two separate hypotheses
recently advanced, parallelism is of course disproved
altogether. But such views are as yet undemonstrated and seem
extreme; and if, after continued search of the evidence, two or
more such associations or complex parallels as the exogamic-totemic
scheme of society stand as independent growths, it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
evident that they will be something in the nature of cultural
manifestations of psychological forces. In short, we should then
be beginning to grasp specific psychological determinants for the
phenomena or events of civilization. But as yet such a causal
explanation of the data of anthropology by the mechanism of
psychology has not been achieved.</p>

<h3 id="section112">112. <span class="smcap">Limitations on the Principle</span></h3>

<p>From the evidences reviewed in this and the last chapter, the
conclusion is confirmed which social philosophers had long since
reached, that imitation is the normal process by which men live,
and that invention is rare, a thing which societies and individuals
oppose with more resistance than they are ever aware
of, and which probably occurs only as the result of the pressure
of special circumstances, although these are as yet little understood.
Not only are a hundred instances of diffusion historically
traceable for every one of parallelism, but the latter is regularly
limited in scope. Something tends to make us see phenomena
more parallel than they actually are. They merely
spring from the same impulse, they inhere in the properties of
objects or nature, they bear resemblance at one point only—and
differ at all other points. Yet they tend to impress us, in
some mysterious way, as almost identical. The history of civilization
has no more produced two like cultures, or two separately
developed identical culture traits, than has the evolution
of organic life ever duplicated a species by convergently modifying
two distinct forms. A whale may look fishlike, he is a
mammal. The Hindu and the Maya zero are logically the same;
actually they have in common nothing but their abstract value:
their shapes, their place in their systems, are different. The
most frequent process of culture history therefore is one of tradition
or diffusion in time and space, corresponding roughly to
hereditary transmission in the field of organic life. Inventions
may be thought of as similar to organic mutations, those “spontaneous”
variations that from time to time arise and establish
themselves. The particular causes of both inventions and mutations
remain as good as unknown. Now and then a mutant or
an invention heads in the same direction as another previously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
arisen one. But, since they spring from different antecedents,
such convergences never attain identity. They remain on the
level of analogous resemblance. Substantial identity, a part for
part correspondence, is invariably a sign of common origin, in
cultural as well as organic history.</p>

</div>

<p>In exemplification of the principles discussed in the last two
chapters, the next two are given over to a more detailed consideration
of several typical ramifying growths whose history happens
to be known with satisfactory fullness. These are the arch,
the week, and the alphabet.</p>

<h3 id="section113">113. <span class="smcap">House Building and Architecture</span></h3>

<p>The history of human building makes a first impression of
an endless tangle. Every people rears some sort of habitations,
and however rude these are, structural principles are involved.
Obviously, too, geography and climate are bound to have at least
a delimiting influence. The Eskimo of the Arctic cannot build
houses of wood; the inhabitants of a coral reef in the Pacific
could not, however much they might wish, develop a style in
brick. In structures not used as dwellings, their purpose necessarily
affects their form. A temple is likely to be made on a
different plan from a court of law. Temples themselves may
vary according to the motives and rituals of the religions which
they serve.</p>

<p>Bewilderment begins to abate as soon as one ceases trying to
contemplate all buildings reared by human hands. Obviously
a dwelling erected by a small family group for the utilitarian
purpose of shelter is likely to be more subject to immediate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
adaptations to climate than a large communal structure serving
some purpose such as the service of a deity. If consideration
be restricted still further, to religious or public buildings set up
with the idea of permanence, another class of causes making for
variability begins to be eliminated. A structure intended as an
enduring monument is reared with consideration to the impression
that it will create in the minds of future generations. Its
emotional potentialities, be these evoked by its mere size, by the
æsthetic nature of its design, or by a combination of the two,
come into the forefront. Such permanent buildings being in
stone or brick, techniques which flourish in wood or other temporary
materials are eliminated. Finally, a monumental structure
is possible only at the hands of a community of some size.
An unstable group of nomads, a thinly scattered agricultural
population, cannot assemble in sufficient numbers even for periods
each year, to carry out the long-continued labors that are
necessary. The aggregation of numbers of men in one spot is
always accompanied by specialization in advancement of the
arts. Consequently the very fact that a structure is monumental
involves the probability that its builders are able to rise
above the limitations of mere necessity, and can in some degree
execute products of their imagination.</p>

<h3 id="section114">114. <span class="smcap">The Problem of Spanning</span></h3>

<p>If now our attention be confined to large buildings of the
more massive and permanent sort, it becomes clear that one of
the chief problems which all their constructors have had to
grapple with, is that of roofing large spaces and spanning wide
openings in walls. A pyramid can be heaped up, or a wall
reared to a great height, without much other than quantitative
difficulties being encountered. A four hundred foot pyramid
does not differ in principle from the waist-high one that a child
might pile up. The problems which it involves are essentially
the economic and political ones of providing and controlling
the needed multitudes of workers. Architecture as such is in
abeyance and the engineering problems involved are mainly
those of transporting and raising large blocks of stone. Much
the same holds of walls. The Incas, for instance, reared<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
masonry of astounding massiveness and exactness without ever
seriously attempting to solve architectural problems.</p>

<p>Once, however, a structure is planned to cover a wide space,
it becomes architecturally ambitious. The roof of a large
dwelling can be made easily of poles and thatch by such collaborators
as a family might muster. But to span a clear space
of some size in stone requires more than numbers of workers.
The accomplishment also yields definite sense of achievement
which is strong in proportion as the extent of the ceiling is
great. The difficulties are diminished in proportion as the mass
of the structure is large and the clear space is small, but the
satisfying effect is correspondingly decreased. A vault whose
walls are thicker than its interior is wide, produces as chief
impression an effect of massiveness. One feels the solidity of
the structure, the amount of labor that has gone into it; but
one is left without the sense of a worth-while difficulty having
been self-imposed and mastered. Sooner or later, therefore,
after men began to hold themselves available for co-operative
enterprises in numbers, adventurous minds must have been
fired with a desire to grapple with problems of æsthetic construction,
and to leave behind them monuments of triumphant
solution. The story of these voluntary and imaginative endeavors
is the history of monumental art.</p>

<p>Two principal methods have been followed in the solution of
the problem of covering large free spaces. The first is the
method of the column and the lintel; the second that of the arch
or vault. The column and lintel do not differ fundamentally
from the idea of the wall with superimposed roof beams. The
elements of both are vertical support and horizontal beam. In
the arch, however, this simple scheme is departed from, and the
covering elements take on a curved or sloping form. The apparently
free float of the span is stimulatingly impressive, especially
when executed in a heavy and thoroughly rigid material.
The beam is subject to bending stress. Timber makes a good
material because of its strength against breakage by bending.
Stone is unreliable or outrightly weak against a bending stress,
besides adding to the stress by its own weight. There are therefore
inherent limitations on the space that can be covered by
a horizontal stone beam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<h3 id="section115">115. <span class="smcap">The Column and Beam</span></h3>

<p>Most early architecture developed the column. Even so superb
an architecture as that of the Greeks never rose above it.
The æsthetic value of the Parthenon lies in the balance and
feeling with which a fundamentally simple plan has been elaborated,
not in the daring way in which an inherently ambitious
problem has been met.</p>

<p>On account of its essential simplicity, columnar architecture
grew up among several historically unconnected nations. In the
case of most of them, there can be distinguished an early stage
of building in wood, when the column was the trunk of a tree,
and a later stage in which the post was replaced by a monolith,
or by superimposed drums of stone. This change appears to
have taken place somewhat independently in Egypt and in
Greece, and wholly so in Mexico. It has been thought that Greek
architecture was derived from Egypt, but there was probably
little more than a transmission of stimulus, since Greek temples
were wooden pillared several thousand years after the Egyptians
were rearing huge stone columns. Furthermore, if the Greeks
had borrowed their column outright from Egypt, they would
probably have copied it slavishly at the outset. Yet their early
capitals are without the lotus flower head in which the Egyptian
column terminated. Here, then, and still more in Mexico, there
was parallel development.</p>

<p>The failure of the Greeks to pass beyond column and lintel
architecture may seem strange for a people that showed so unusual
an artistic faculty and so bold and enterprising a spirit
as they manifested in most departments of civilization. The
cause appears to lie not in any internal arrest of their artistic
evolution, but in the conditions that prevailed in another field
of their culture: their political particularity. The Greek state
remained a city. All attempts to establish larger political aggregates,
whether on the basis of confederation or conquest, failed
miserably and speedily. The Greek was ingrainedly addicted
to an outlook that was not merely provincial but literally
municipal. The result was that really large coöperative enterprises
were beyond him. Paved roads, aqueducts, sewers, and
works of a like character were scarcely attempted on any scale<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
of magnitude. With the rather small numbers of individuals
which at best the Greeks assembled in one spot, such works were
not necessary, and undertaken in mere ambition, they would
have encountered public antagonism. Consequently Greek public
buildings were, by the standards of many other nations,
mediocre in size of ground plan, low in height, without endeavor
to impress by sweep of clear space. This fact illustrates the
almost organic interconnection existing between the several sides
of the culture of any people; it illustrates also the importance
of knowing the whole of a civilization before trying to
provide an explanation for any one of its manifestations.</p>

<h3 id="section116">116. <span class="smcap">The Corbelled Arch</span></h3>

<p>The arch brings in an inherently new principle of architecture.
It is a device for carrying construction over an empty
space without horizontal beams. But it may take two principal
forms: the corbelled or “false” arch, and the “true” arch.
Both are arches in form, but the blocks that form the curvature
of one are not self-supporting; in the other they are.</p>

<p>The corbelled arch achieves its span through a successive projection
of the stones or bricks that abut on each side of the open
space. The stone at the end of the second course of masonry
extends part of its length beyond the end stone of the first
course. At the opposite side, the second course hangs similarly
out above the first. In the third course, the end blocks again
project beyond those of the second. The arrangement thus is
that of two series of brackets, or two staircases turned upside
down. The higher the masonry rises, the more do the clear
space narrow and the two lines of hanging steps approach until
they meet and the arch is complete. What keeps the projecting
stones from toppling into the clear space? Nothing, obviously,
but such weight as is put on their inner or embedded ends.
Suppose a stone projects a third of its length beyond the one
below, so that its center of gravity is still above the lower stone.
It will then lie as placed. Suppose still another stone again
projects a third of its length beyond the second. Its center of
gravity now falling outside the lowest block, it will topple both
itself and the second one. Only if other blocks are inserted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
behind will their counterweight hold up the projecting blocks.
Obviously, there will be more such counterweights needed the
higher the side of the arch rises. In general, the area of wall
needed as counterweight is at least as great as the area of overhanging.
If the arch is to clear ten feet horizontally—hanging
over five feet from each side—there must be five feet or more
of masonry built up on each side of the clear space. A corbelled
arch forming a relatively small doorway in the face of
a wall presents no difficulty, but a corbelled arch that stands
free is impossible.</p>

<p>The same principle holds for the vault, which is a three-dimensional
extension of the virtually two-dimensional arch.
The hollow or half-barrel of the corbelled vault has to be flanked
by a volume of building material exceeding its own content.
This need eliminates corbelling as a possible method of rearing
structures that rise free and with lightness. Hence the clumsy
massiveness of, for instance, Maya architecture, which, so far
as it employs the vault, often contains more building material
than spanned space.</p>

<p>Another difficulty, beyond that of counterweighting, which
besets the user of the corbelled arch, is that the projecting stones
of each course are subjected to the same bending strain as a
beam. The weight above strives to snap them in two.</p>

<p>The corbelled arch and vault have been independently devised
and have also diffused. They were employed in gigantic Bronze
age tombs at Mycenæ in Greece—the so-called treasure house of
Atreus,—in Portugal, and in Ireland (<a href="#figure41">Fig. 41</a>). These developments
seem historically connected. On the other hand the Mayas
of Yucatan also built corbelled arches, which must constitute a
separate invention. This parallel development differs from that
of the true arch, which seems everywhere to be derived from a
single original source.</p>

<h3 id="section117">117. <span class="smcap">The True Arch</span></h3>

<p>The true arch differs from the corbelled in needing no counterweight.
The blocks that form the under surface or soffit of
its span are self-sustaining. The true arch thus yields an
æsthetic satisfaction which can be attained in no other way,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
especially when it soars in magnitude. The fundamental principle
of the true arch is the integration of its elements. Such
an arch is nothing until completed; but from that moment its
constituents fuse their strength. Each block has a shape which
is predetermined by the design of the whole, and each is useless,
in fact, not even self-supporting, until all the others have
been fitted with it. Hence the figure of speech as well as the
reality of the keystone: the last block slipped into place, locking
itself and all the others. The features of the blocks or “voussoirs”
which makes possible this integration, is the taper of
their sides. Each is a gently sloping piece of wedge instead
of a rectangular block. When bricks replace dressed stone, the
mortar takes the place of this shaping, being thinner toward the
inner face of the vault and thicker toward the interior of the
construction.</p>

<p>A true arch in process of erection would instantly collapse if
not held up. It can be built only over a scaffold or “centering.”
Once however the keystone has wedged its parts together, it not
only stands by itself but will support an enormous weight. The
greater the pressure from above, the more tightly are the blocks
forced together. Instability in a true arch is not due to the
bending stress coming from the superimposed mass, as in the
corbelled arch or a horizontal roofing. The blocks are subjected
only to crushing pressure, which stone and brick are specially
adapted to withstand. The weakness of the arch is that it turns
vertical into horizontal thrust. With more weight piled on top,
the sidewise thrust, the inclination to spread apart, becomes
greater, and must be resisted by buttressing. This is what the
Hindus mean when they say that “the arch never sleeps.”</p>

<h3 id="section118">118. <span class="smcap">Babylonian and Etruscan Beginnings</span></h3>

<p>While the exact circumstances attending the invention of the
true arch are not clear, the earliest specimens preserved are from
the ancient brick-building peoples of Babylonia, especially at
Nippur about 3,000 B.C. Thence the principle of the arch was
carried to adjacent Assyria. Both these Mesopotamian peoples
employed the arch chiefly on a small scale in roofing doors and
in tunnels. It remained humble and utilitarian in their hands;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
its architectural possibilities were scarcely conceived. They
continued to rear their monumental structures mainly with an
eye to quantity: high and thick walls, ramps, towers ascending
vertically or by steps, prevailed.</p>

<p>The true arch and vault are next found in Italy, among a
prosperous city-dwelling people, the Etruscans, some seven or
more centuries before Christ. All through the civilization of
this nation runs a trait of successful but never really distinctive
accomplishment. The Etruscans were receptive to new ideas and
applied them with energy, usually only to degenerate them in
the end. Whether they discovered the arch for themselves or
whether knowledge of it was carried to Italy from Asia is not
wholly clear, since history knows little about the Etruscans, and
archæology, though yielding numerous remains, leaves the problem
of their origin dark. The Etruscans, or Tyrrhenians as the
Greeks knew them, were however active traders, and a number
of features in their civilization, such as liver divination (§ <a href="#section97">97</a>),
as well as ancient tradition, connect them with Asia. It is
therefore probable that the principle of arch construction was
transmitted to them from its earlier Babylonian source. The
Etruscans also failed to carry the use of the arch far into monumental
architecture. They employed it in tombs, gates, and
drains rather than as a conspicuous feature of public buildings.</p>

<h3 id="section119">119. <span class="smcap">The Roman Arch and Dome</span></h3>

<p>From the Etruscans their neighbors, the Romans, learned the
arch. They too adopted it at first for utilitarian purposes. The
great sewer of Rome, for instance, the Cloaca Maxima, is an
arched vault of brick. Gradually, however, as the Romans grew
in numbers and wealth and acquired a taste for public undertakings,
they transferred the construction to stone and introduced
it into their buildings. By the time their polity changed
from the republican to the imperial form, the arch was the most
characteristic feature of their architecture. The Greeks had
built porticos of columns; the Romans erected frontages of rows
of arches. The exterior of their circus, the Coliseum, is a series
of stories of arches. Much of the mass of the structure also rests
upon arches, thus making possible the building of the huge edifice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
with a minimum of material. On the practical side, this is
one of the chief values of the arch. The skill which evolved it
eliminates a large percentage of brute labor. Earlier peoples
would have felt it necessary to fill the space between the interior
tiers of seats and the outer wall of the Coliseum.</p>

<p>Once the fever of architecture had infected them, the Romans
went beyond the simple arch and vault. They invented the
dome. As the simplest arch, such as a doorway or window, a
perforation in a wall, is essentially two dimensional, and a
vault is the projecting of this plane area into the three dimensions
of a half cylinder, so the dome can be conceived as the
extension of the arch into another three-dimensional form, the
half sphere. Their relations are those of a hoop, a barrel, and
a hollow ball. Imagine a vault revolved on a central vertical
pivot, and it will describe the surface of a dome. Two intersecting
arches can be served by a single keystone. Theoretically,
more and more arches can be introduced to intersect at the same
point, until they form a continuous spheroid surface. Neither
construction nor the evolution of the dome did actually take
place by this method of compounding arches, which however
serves to illustrate the logical relation of the two structures.</p>

<p>The Roman engineers put domes on their Pantheon, the tomb
of Hadrian, and other buildings. In the centuries in which the
Mediterranean countries were Romanized, the dome and the
arch, the vault and the row of arches set on pillars, became
familiar to all the inhabitants of the civilized western world.
After Roman power crumbled, the architectural traditions survived.
Even when there was decadence of execution and little
monumental construction, the principles once gained were never
lost.</p>

<h3 id="section120">120. <span class="smcap">Mediæval Cathedrals</span></h3>

<p>With the emergence from the Dark to the Middle Ages, architecture
revived with an application to churches instead of temples,
circuses, and baths. In southern Europe adherence to the
old Roman model remained close, and the style is known as
Romanesque. In northern Europe the Roman principles found
themselves on newer soil, tradition bound less rigorously, and
the style underwent more modification. The arch became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
pointed at the top. Vertical building lines were elongated at
the expense of horizontal ones, which in the lower and less brilliant
sun of the north are less effective in catching light and
shade and giving plastic effect than on the Mediterranean. The
dominant effect became one of aspiration toward height. This
is the so-called Gothic architecture, developed from the twelfth
century on, most notably in northern France, with much originality
also in England, and undergoing provincial modification
in the various north European countries. In fact, the style was
finally carried back into Italy, to compete there with the Romanesque
order, as in the famous cathedral of Milan.</p>

<p>As an artistic design a Gothic cathedral is as different from
an imperial Roman building as the latter from a Greek temple.
Yet it represents nothing but a surface modification of Roman
methods. Its essential engineering problems had been solved
more than a thousand years earlier. The effect of a hemispherical
arch associated with low round columns, and of a high
pointed one soaring from tall clusters of buttresses, is as diverse
as can be obtained in architecture. But so far as plan or invention
are concerned, there is no decisive distinction between the
two orders.</p>

<h3 id="section121">121. <span class="smcap">The Arabs: India: Modern Architecture</span></h3>

<p>In the east, Roman architectural tradition was sustained without
rupture and even carried forward in the Byzantine empire.
The great church of St. Sophia at Constantinople is a sixth century
example of a splendid dome set on four great arches and
intersecting with smaller domes at its corners. From the Byzantine
Greeks—or Romans as they long continued to call themselves—and
perhaps from the neighboring Sassanian Persians,
the principle of arch and dome came to the Arabs when these
underwent their sudden expansion after the death of Mohammed.
In nearly all the countries overrun by the Arabs, Mesopotamia,
Syria, Egypt, North Africa, Sicily, and Spain, they encountered
innumerable old public buildings or ruins. It was not long
before they were emulating these. During the centuries superficial
fashion does not stand still in architecture any more than
in dress. The trousers of 1850 would seem out of place if worn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
in 1920, and yet the two garments are identical in basic plan.
So with Roman and Arab or Saracenic architecture. The Arab
sometimes twisted his columns and bulged his arch to horseshoe
shape. He added no essential element.</p>

<p>Among the countries in which the Arabs built is Spain.
Hence their architecture, in the form known as Moorish, influenced
that of the Spaniards. They in turn carried the style
to Mexico; from there it was transported to New Mexico and
California, where converted Indians made and laid the adobe
bricks of their mission churches according to the plans of the
padres. Since the American occupation, the buildings and ruins
of the Spanish period have stood out as landmarks, fired the
imagination of visitors, and set the model for a type of architecture.
Railroad stations and the like are now done in “Mission”
style, which in essentials is nothing but Spanish Moorish
architecture, as this again is only the Arab modification of the
Roman original.</p>

<p>Along with Mohammedanism, the Roman-Saracenic architecture
spread eastward also to India. In the sixteenth century
Mohammedan conquerors of Mongol origin, known therefore as
the Moguls, carved out a great empire in northern India. Prosperity
resulted for several generations, and its memory was
embellished by the erection of notable buildings. Perhaps the
most famous of these is the tomb near Agra known as the Taj
Mahal. Set in its sunlit environment, built of white marble,
and its surface a maze of inlay in polished stone, this structure
seems utterly unrelated to the grim, narrow, upward-stretching
cathedrals of northern Europe with stained glass filling the
spaces between their buttresses. Yet the central feature of the
Taj Mahal is a great dome done on the identical plan as that
of St. Sophia or the Pantheon and derived from them. What
then one is wont to regard as the triumph of Indian architecture
is not Indian at all; no more than Gothic architecture had any
connection with the Goths. The one is Mohammedan, the other
French. Both represent little else than the working out in new
countries and in later centuries of an invention which the Romans
had borrowed from the Etruscans and they from the
Babylonians. The device diffused from Asia into Europe and
Africa and returned after several thousand years, to flourish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
once more near its source of origin, enormously modified
æsthetically and enriched with infinite refinement, but still
without radical change.</p>

<p>It is an interesting commentary on the sluggishness of invention
that whereas we to-day build in concrete and steel as well
as in wood and brick and stone, and erect buildings of greater
size as well as for a larger variety of purposes than ever before
in history, yet we have so far been unable to add any new type
of æsthetic design. Our public buildings, those intended to serve
as monuments and therefore summoning the utmost abilities of
the architect, still make use of the arch, vault, and dome, or
fall back frankly on modifications of the Greek temple with its
rows of columns. So far as the outside appearance of modern
buildings goes, all our fine architecture is essentially a burrowing
in the past to recombine in slightly new proportions, and
for new uses, elements taken from the most diverse countries
and ages, but forming part of only two lines of development.
It may be, when we have built much longer in steel and concrete,
and perhaps still newer materials, that the inherent properties
of these may gradually force on a future generation of
architects and engineers possibilities which indeed are now lying
before us, but to which the resistance of the human mind to
novelty blinds us.</p>

<h3 id="section122">122. <span class="smcap">The Week: Holy Numbers</span></h3>

<p>The history of the week is also a meandering one. Its origins
go back to a number cult. Many nations have a habit of looking
upon some one number as specially lucky, desirable, holy, or
perhaps unfortunate; at any rate endowed with peculiar virtue
or power. Three and seven at once rise to mind, with thirteen
as unfortunate. But the particular numbers considered mystic
are very diverse. Few American Indian tribes, for instance,
had any feeling about seven,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and still fewer about three. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
latter, in fact, would have seemed to almost all of them imperfect
and insignificant. Nearly all the Americans who were conscious
of any preferential custom exalted four; and the remaining
tribes, those of the North Pacific Coast, were addicted to
five. The Africans were without any feeling for seven, except
where they had come under Islamic or other foreign influences.
The Australians and Pacific islanders also have not concerned
themselves with seven, and the same seems to be true of those
remoter peoples of northern Asia which remained until recently
beyond the range of the irradiation of higher civilization.</p>

<p>This reduces the area in which seven is thought to have sacred
power to a single continuous tract comprising Europe, the culturally
advanced portions of Asia and the East Indies, and such
parts of Africa as have come under Eur-Asiatic influence. It
is significant that seven was devoid of special significance in
ancient Egypt. This circumscribed distribution suggests diffusion
from a single originating center. Where this may have
been, there is no direct evidence to show, but there are indications
that it lay in Babylonia. Here mathematics, astrology,
and divination flourished at an early time. Since the art of
foretelling the issue of events from examination of a victim’s
liver spread from Babylonia to Italy on one side and to Borneo
on the other, it is the more likely that the equally ancient attribution
of mystic virtue to seven may have undergone the same
diffusion. In fact, the two practices may have traveled as part
of a “complex.” The Greeks and Hebrews are virtually out
of question as originators because they were already thinking
in terms of seven at a time when they were only receiving culture
elements from Babylonia without giving anything in return.</p>

<h3 id="section123">123. <span class="smcap">Babylonian Discovery of the Planets</span></h3>

<p>The Babylonians, together with the Egyptians, were also the
first astronomers. The Egyptians turned their interest to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
sun and the year, and devised the earliest accurate solar calendar.
The Babylonians lagged behind in this respect, adhering to a
cumbersome lunar-solar calendar. But they acquired more information
as to other heavenly phenomena: the phases of the
moon, eclipses, the courses of the planets. They devised the
zodiac and learned to half predict eclipses. It is true that their
interest in these realms was not scientific in the modern sense,
but sacerdotal and magical. An eclipse was a misfortune, an
expected eclipse that did not “come off,” a cause for rejoicing.
Yet this superstitious interest did lead the Babylonians to
genuine astronomical discoveries.</p>

<p>Among these was the observation that five luminaries besides
the sun and moon move regularly across the heavens, visible
to the naked eye and independent of the host of fixed stars: the
planets that we call Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
This impressive fact must have significance, they felt, and from
anthropocentric reasons they found the significance in the influence
of these bodies on the fortunes of men. This was the
beginning of astrology, which charlatans and dupes still practise
among ourselves, but which in its youth represented one of the
triumphs of civilized knowledge. The planets were identified
with gods by the Babylonians, at any rate named after gods.</p>

<p>It is even probable that the ancient priest-astronomer-magicians
were driven to distinguish the full set of observable planets
by their desire to attain the full number seven. It is not an
obvious thing by any means that the all-illuminating sun should
be set on a par with moving stars that at times are no more
conspicuous than some fixed ones. No people unaffected by the
Babylonian precedent has ever hit upon the strange device of
reckoning sun and moon as stars. Then, too, Mercury is perceptible
with difficulty, on account of its proximity to the sun.
It is said that great astronomers of a few centuries ago sometimes
never in their lives saw this innermost of the planets with
naked eye, at least in northern latitudes. It seems possible
therefore that its Babylonian discovery may have been hastened
by an eagerness to attain the perfect seven for the number of
the traveling bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span></p>

<h3 id="section124">124. <span class="smcap">Greek and Egyptian Contributions: the Astrological Combination</span></h3>

<p>After the conquest of western Asia by Alexander, the Hellenistic
Greeks took over the undifferentiated Babylonian astrology-astronomy
and developed it into a science. They for the first
time determined the distance or order of the seven luminaries
from the earth, and determined it as correctly as was possible
as long as it was assumed that our earth formed the center of
the universe. Ptolemy—the astronomer, not the king—placed
Saturn as the most outward, next Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus,
Mercury, Moon.</p>

<p>This scientific advance, the west Asiatic astrologers again took
hold of and brought into connection with the hours of the day.
For this purpose they employed not the old Babylonian division
of the day and night into twelve hours—which had long since
passed over to the Greeks—but the Egyptian reckoning of
twenty-four. This was possible because the Greek discoveries
were made in the Egyptian city of Alexandria.</p>

<p>Each of the twenty-four hours in turn was assigned by the
astrologers to a planet in the Ptolemaic order, beginning with
Saturn. As there were only the seven, the cycle began over
again on the eighth hour, and in the same way the fifteenth and
twenty-second were “dominated” by Saturn. This gave the
twenty-third to Jupiter, the twenty-fourth to Mars, and the
twenty-fifth—the first of the next day, to the Sun. This second
day was thought to be specially under the influence of the planet
of its initial hour, the Sun, as the first was under the influence
of its initial hour, that of Saturn. With the continuance of the
count, the Moon would become dominant of the first hour of
the third day, and so on through the repeated series, the remaining
planets emerging in the sequence Mars, Mercury,
Jupiter, Venus; whereupon, the cycle having been exhausted,
it would begin all over again with Saturn’s day—Saturday, as
we still call it—and its successors Sun’s day and Moon’s day.</p>

<p>This was the week as we know it, evolved perhaps somewhat
more than a century before Christ, soon carried back into Alexandria,
and there imparted to Greeks, Romans, and other nationalities.
By the time Jesus was preaching, knowledge of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
planetary week had reached Rome. Less than a century later,
its days were being written in Pompeii. In another hundred
years it was spoken of by contemporaries as internationally
familiar.</p>

<h3 id="section125">125. <span class="smcap">The Names of the Days and the Sabbath</span></h3>

<p>As yet, however, the week was more of a plaything of the
superstitious than a civil or religious institution; and it was
pagan, not Christian. The names of the days were those of the
gods which the Babylonians had assigned to the planets a thousand
or more years earlier, or, in the Western world, “translations”
of the Babylonian god names. The Greeks had long
before, in naming the stars which we know as Mercury, Jupiter,
Venus, substituted their Hermes, Zeus, Aphrodite for the Babylonian
Nabu, Marduk, Ishtar, on the basis of some resemblance
of attributes. Thus, Nabu had to do with learning or cunning
like Hermes; Marduk, like Zeus, wielded thunder; Ishtar and
Aphrodite were both goddesses of love. The Romans, in turn,
“translated” the Greek names into those of their divinities
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, which survive for instance in French
Mercre-di, Jeu-di, Vendre-di.</p>

<p>In the passing on of the week to the Germanic barbarians,
still another “translation” was made, to Woden, Thor, Frija,
whence English Wedn-es-day, Thur-s-day, Fri-day. It is true
that these northern gods were not equivalents of the Roman ones,
but that mattered little. The reckoning of the week was growing
in frequency, and some sort of familiar and pronounceable
names for its days had to be found for the new peoples to whom
it spread. So a minimum of resemblance between two deities
answered for an identification. Moreover, the ancients, because
they believed in the reality of their gods but not in the infinity
of their number, were in the habit of assuming that the deities
of foreign nations must be at bottom the same as their own.
Therefore a considerable discrepancy of attribute or worship
troubled them no more than the difference in name.</p>

<p>For the days of the week, then, which the public came more
and more to deal with, these translations were made. Astronomy,
however, was in the hands of the learned, who knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
Latin; and hence scientists still denote the planets as Mercury,
Venus, and so on, instead of Woden and Frija.</p>

<p>Jesus observed the Sabbath, not Sunday, which he was either
ignorant of or would have denounced as polytheistic. The Sabbath
was an old Hebrew institution, a day of abstention and
cessation from labor, evidently connected with and perhaps derived
from the Babylonian Shabattum. These shabattum were
the seventh, fourteenth, twenty-first, twenty-eighth, and also
nineteenth days of the month, the first four probably having
reference to the phases of the moon, and all five being “days
of rest of the heart,” inauspicious for undertakings, and therefore
unfavorable for work. They were thus tabooed, supramundane
days, and while their recurrence chiefly at seven day
intervals, like that of the Jewish Sabbath, provided a sort of
frame for a week, this week was never filled in. The influence
of the Babylonian-Hebrew Sabbath on the development of the
week was chiefly this: it provided the early Christians with a
ready-made habit of religiously observing one day in seven.
This period coinciding with the seven day scheme of the week
that was coming into use among pagans, ultimately reinforced
the week with the authority of the church.</p>

<h3 id="section126">126. <span class="smcap">The Week in Christianity, Islam, and Eastern Asia</span></h3>

<p>Christianity however felt and long resisted the essential
paganism of the week. The Roman Catholic church in its
calendar recognizes the Lord’s day, the second to sixth days,
and the Sabbath, but none named after a heathen god. In
Greece the influence of the Orthodox church has been strong
enough to establish a similar numbering in civil life; and the
Slavic nations, also mostly Orthodox, follow the same system
except that our Monday is their “first” day and they close the
week with Sunday.</p>

<p>Sunday, instead of Sabbath-Saturday, became the religious
day of the week in Christianity because of the early tradition
that it was on this day that Jesus rose from the dead. An
unconscious motive of perhaps greater influence was the desire
to differentiate the new religion from its Sabbath-observing
mother religion, both in the minds of converts from Judaism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
and in the opinion of the pagans. The Romans for about a
century confused Jews and Christians, no doubt to the irritation
of both.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the pagans themselves, perhaps under the influence
of the popular sun-worshiping Mithraic religion of the
second and third centuries, had come to look upon the Sun’s
day instead of Saturn’s as the first of the week. At any rate,
in 321 A.D. Constantine ordained “the venerable day of the
Sun” as a legal holiday from governmental, civic, and industrial
activity. Constantine perhaps issued this decree as high priest
of the state religion of the Roman empire, but he was also the
first Christian emperor, and his action must have been wholly
acceptable to the church. Before long, church and state were in
accord to discountenance work on Sunday; and thus Christianity
had adopted the heathen planetary week in all respects but the
names of its days. Protestantism finally withdrew even this
barrier and accepted the planet-god names that had so long
been popularly and civilly established.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan week is that of Judaism and Eastern
Christianity, and was taken over bodily from one or the other
of these religions. Sunday is the “first” day, and so in order
to Thursday. Friday is “the meeting,” when one prays at the
mosque, but labors before and after, if one wishes. And Saturday
is “the Sabbath,” though of course without its Jewish
prescriptions and restrictions. The Arabs have spread this form
of the week far into Africa.</p>

<p>But the planetary week of Babylonian-Greek-Egyptian-Syrian
origin spread east as well as west and north and south. It
never became so charged with religious meaning nor so definitely
established as a civil and economic institution in Asia as in Europe,
but it was used astronomically, calendrically, and in divination.
By the fifth century, it had been introduced into
India. For a time after the tenth century, it was more used
in dating than among European nations. Again “translations”
of the god names of the planets were made: Brihaspati was
Jupiter, and Brihaspati-vara Thursday.</p>

<p>From India, the week spread north into Tibet, east to the
Indo-Chinese countries, and southeast to the Malay Peninsula,
Sumatra, and Java. In the former lands, it was employed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
calendrically; among the Malaysians, rather astrologically, and
has been largely superseded by the Mohammedan form. Even
China acquired some slight acquaintance with the week as a
period of seven days allotted to the planetary bodies and initiated
by the day of Mit, that is, Mithra, the Persian sun god,
although the average Chinaman knows nothing of the days of
the week nor any periodic rest from labor.</p>

<h3 id="section127">127. <span class="smcap">Summary of the Diffusion</span></h3>

<p>This history of the week is one of the striking instances of
institutional diffusion. An ancient west Asiatic mystic valuation
or magical cult of the number seven led on the one hand
to an observance of taboo days, on the other to an association
with the earliest astronomical knowledge, polytheistic worship,
and divination. A European people learned the combination
and built on it for further scientific progress, only to have this
gain utilized for new playing by the astrologers. The planetary
week, the creation of these mathematical diviners, was reintroduced
into Europe and became connected with the calendar and
civil life. Christianity recontributed the old idea of regularly
recurring holy or taboo days. Mohammedanism took over this
concept along with the period, but without the polytheistic and
astrological elements. Eastern Asia, on the other hand, was
chiefly interested in the latter. With us, the significance is becoming
increasingly economic. Names have changed again and
again, but their very variations evidence their equivalence. In
about three thousand years from its first beginnings and half as
many from its definitive establishment, the institution of the
week by 1492 had spread over all the earth except the peripheral
tracts of Asia and Africa and the peripheral continents of
Oceania and America.</p>

<h3 id="section128">128. <span class="smcap">Month-thirds and Market Weeks</span></h3>

<p>Contrasting with this single diffusion of the seven-day week
is the independent development in several parts of the world
of other periods, marked either by sacred or secularly unlucky
days or by markets or by divisions of the lunar month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>For instance, a ten-day week, having reference to the beginning,
middle, and end of the lunation, was more or less reckoned
with in ancient Egypt; ancient Greece; parts of modern central
Africa; China, Japan, and Indo-China; and Polynesia. No historic
connections are known between the custom in these regions;
its official and religious associations are everywhere slender, and
intervening nations either employ other periods or none at all.
It looks, therefore, as if these might be cases of true parallelism,
although in that event an American occurrence might also be
expected and its absence seems in need of explanation. Moreover
there is nothing very important about this reckoning; it is
essentially a description of a natural event, and the only thing
distinctive is its being threefold. If an institution as precise and
artificial as our planetary week had been independently originated
more than once, the fact would be more significant.</p>

<p>Regular market days among agricultural peoples have frequently
led to a reckoning of time superficially resembling the
week. Thus, in central Africa, south of the sphere of Islamic
influences, markets are observed by a considerable number of
tribes. Most frequently these come at four day intervals. Some
tribes shorten the period to three days or lengthen it to five.
Six, eight, and ten day periods appear to be merely doublings.
The fairly compact distribution of this African market week
points to a single origin.</p>

<p>The early Romans observed a regular eighth day market and
semi-holiday. This might be connected with the African institution,
but as yet cannot be historically linked with it.</p>

<p>In the less advanced states of Indo-China and many of the
East Indian islands, even as far as New Guinea, five-day markets
are the rule. This entire tract has many internal culture connections,
so that within its limits diffusion has evidently again
been active.</p>

<p>In ancient America, markets were customary every fifth day
in Mexico, third day in Colombia, tenth day in Peru. These
were also days of assembly and cessation from labor.</p>

<p>The American instances establish beyond cavil that some of
these market weeks are truly independent evolutions. Moreover,
they nearly all occur among peoples of about the same
degree of advancement, at any rate on the economic side of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
cultures. But it is only the idea, the outline of the institution,
that is similar; its concrete cultural execution, as expressed in
the length of the period, differs in Asia and Africa, and in the
three American regions. That the Mexican and Southeast
Asiatic weeks were both of five days, means nothing but the sort
of coincidence to be expected when the choice of duration is
limited to a small range, such as between three and ten days.</p>

<h3 id="section129">129. <span class="smcap">Leap Days as Parallels</span></h3>

<p>Finally, there is a correspondence between the Egyptians and
Mexicans in recognizing the solar year as composed of 360 + 5
days. The Egyptians counted the 360 in twelve months of thirty
days, the Mayas and Aztecs in eighteen groups of twenty days;
both agreed in regarding the five leap days as supplementary and
unlucky. This last fact looks like a close correspondence, but
analysis dissolves much of the likeness. The solar year consists
of 365 days and a fraction. There is nothing cultural about that
phenomenon except its recognition. Careful observation continued
for a long enough period inevitably yields the result.
But 365 is indivisible except by 5 and 73; 360 is much
“rounder,” that is, divisible by many numbers, and these
“simple” like 6, 10, 12, 18, 20, 30, and therefore easier to operate
with. This again is a mathematical, not a cultural fact. The
five supplementary days thus scarcely represent any distinctive
achievement. As to their being considered unlucky and evil,
that is unquestionably a true cultural parallel.</p>

<p>At the same time, this parallel cannot be enacted into any
generally valid law. The ancient Hindu calendar, being directly
lunar, had about twelve days left over each solar year end at
the winter solstice. These twelve days were looked upon as
prophetic and portentous, but not as specifically evil. The Persian
and Armenian calendars, seemingly derived from the
Egyptian, had the same five supplementary days. But in the
former the first of its five is reckoned as lucky, only the third
as unlucky; and in the latter, none of the five has any special
value or observance. Our own twenty-ninth of February is
supplementary and we hold a half serious belief or superstition
in regard to it and its year, but this has nothing to do with luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>In short, the human mind does tend to attach an unusual value
to any day in the calendar that is in any way outstanding.
This observation is a psychological one, and could be predicted
from what is known of the principle of association in individual
psychology. When it comes to the social expression of this
tendency, regularity ceases. Sometimes the value of the special
day is virtually identical among unconnected social groups, such
as the Mayas and Egyptians; sometimes it is diverse, as between
them and ourselves; and sometimes the value wholly disappears,
as in Armenia. Parallelism in any matter of civilization is
never complete and perfect, just as culture elements rarely
spread far or long without modification.</p>

<h3 id="section130">130. <span class="smcap">Kinds of Writing: Pictographic and Mixed Phonetic</span></h3>

<p>Three stages are logically distinguishable in the development
of writing. The first is the use of pictures of things and symbols
of ideas: the pictographic method. In the second stage the
representation of sounds begins, but is made through pictures
or abbreviations of pictures: and pictures or ideographs as such
continue to be used alongside the pictures whose value is
phonetic. This may be called the mixed or transitional or rebus
stage. Third is the phonetic phase. In this, the symbols used,
whatever their origin may have been, no longer denote objects
or ideas but are merely signs for sounds—words, syllables, or the
elemental letter-sounds.</p>

<p>The first of these stages, the pictographic, and the degree to
which it flows, or rather fails to flow spontaneously out of the
human mind, have already been discussed (§ <a href="#section105">105</a>). The second
or transitional stage makes use of the principle that pictures
may either be interpreted directly as pictures or can be named.
A picture or suggestive sketch of the organ of sight may stand
for the thing itself, the eye. Or, the emphasis may be on the
word eye, its sound; then the picture can be made with the
purpose of representing that sound when it has a different
meaning, as in the pronoun “I.” The method is familiar to us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
in the form of the game which we call “rebus,” that is, a method
of writing “with things” or pictures of objects. The insect bee
stands for the abstract verb “be,” two strokes or the figure 2
for the preposition “to,” a picture of a house with the sign
of a tavern, that is an inn, for the prefix “in-,” and so on.
This charade-like method is cumbersome and indirect enough
to provide the difficulty of interpretation that makes it fit for a
game or puzzle. But what to us, who have a system of writing,
is a mere sport or occasional toy, is also the method by which
peoples without writing other than pure pictography made their
first steps toward the writing of words and sounds. The principle
of reading the name instead of the idea of the thing pictured
is therefore a most important invention. It made possible
the writing of pronouns, prepositions, prefixes and suffixes,
grammatical endings, articles, and the like, which are incapable
of representation by pictography alone. There is no difficulty
drawing a recognizable picture of a man, and two or three such
pictures might give the idea of men. But no picture system can
express the difference between “a man” and “the man.” Nor
can relational or abstract ideas like those of “here,” “that,”
“by,” “of,” “you,” “why,” be expressed by pictures.</p>

<h3 id="section131">131. <span class="smcap">Deficiencies of Transitional Systems</span></h3>

<p>Important as the invention of the designation of words or
sounds therefore was, it was at first hesitant, cumbersome, and
incomplete as compared with modern alphabets. For one thing,
many symbols were required. They had to be pictured with
some accuracy to be recognizable. A picture of a bee must be
made with some detail and care to be distinguishable with certainty
from that of a fly or wasp or beetle. An inn must be
drawn with its sign or shield or some clear identifying mark,
else it is likely to be read as house or barn or hut or shop.
The figure of the human eye is a more elaborate character than
the letter I. Then, too, the old pictures did not go out of use.
When the writing referred to bees and inns and eyes, pictures
of these things were written and read as pictures. The result
was that a picture of an eye would in one passage stand for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
organ and in another for the personal pronoun. Which its
meaning was, had to be guessed from the context. If the interpretation
as pronoun fitted best—for instance, if the next characters
meant “tell you”—that interpretation was chosen; but
if the next word were recognized to be “brow,” or “wink,” the
character would be interpreted as denoting the sense organ.
That is, the same characters were sometimes read by their sense
and sometimes by their sound, once pictographically and once
phonetically. Hence the system was really transitional or
mixed, whereas a true alphabet, which represents sounds only,
is unmixed or pure in principle. Owing to the paucity of sound
signs at first, the object or idea signs had to be retained; after
they were once well established, they continued to be kept alongside
the sound signs even after these had grown numerous. The
tenacity of most mixed systems is remarkable. The Egyptians
early added word signs and then syllable and pure letter signs
to their object signs. After they had evolved a set of letter
signs for the principal sounds of their language, they might
perfectly well have discarded all the rest of their hundreds of
characters. But for three thousand years they clung to these,
and wrote pictographic and phonetic characters jumbled together.
They would even duplicate to make sure: as if we
should write e-y-e and then follow with a picture of an eye,
for fear, as it were, that the spelling out was not sufficiently
clear. From our modern point of view it seems at first quite
extraordinary that they should have continued to follow this
plan a thousand years after nations with whom they were in
contact, Phœnicians, Hebrews, Greeks, Romans, were using
simple, brief, accurate, pure alphabets. Yet of course they were
only following the grooves of crystallized habit, as when we
write “weight” or “piece” with unnecessary letters, or employ
a combination of two simple letters each having its own value,
like T and H, to represent a third simple sound, that of TH.
With us, as it was with the Egyptians, it would be more of a
wrench and effort for the adult generation to change to new
and simpler characters or methods than to continue in the old
cumbersome habits. So the advantage of the next generation is
stifled and the established awkward system goes on indefinitely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<h3 id="section132">132. <span class="smcap">Abbreviation and Conventionalization</span></h3>

<p>This mixture of pictographic and ideographic with phonetic
characters, and its long retention, were substantially as characteristic
of Sumerian or Babylonian Cuneiform, of Chinese,
and of Maya and Aztec writing, as of Egyptian. In all of these
systems there was more or less tendency to abbreviate the pictures,
to contract them to a few strokes, to reduce the original
representations to conventional characters. Cuneiform and presumably
Chinese underwent this process early and profoundly.
In Egyptian it also set in and led to Hieratic and later to
Demotic cursive script, which consist of signs that are meaningless
to the eye, although they resolve into standardized reductions
of the pictures which during the same period continued to
be made in the monumental and religious Hieroglyphic. Such
conventional abbreviations made possible a certain speed of production,
rendered writing of use in business and daily life, and
thereby contributed to the spread of literacy. In themselves,
however, they introduced no new principle.</p>

<p>In addition to this conventionality of form of characters,
there is to be distinguished also a conventionalization of meaning
which is inherent in the nature of writing. Conventionalization
of form accompanies frequency or rapidity of writing,
conventionalization of meaning must occur if there is to be any
writing at all. It develops in pure non-phonetic pictography if
this is to be able to express any considerable range of meaning.
An outstretched hand may well be used with the sense of “give.”
But the beholder of the picture-writing is likely to interpret it
as “take.” Here is where conventionalization is necessary: it
must be understood by writers and readers alike that such a
hand means “give” and not “take,” or perhaps the reverse, or
perhaps that if the palm is up and the fingers flat the meaning
is “give” whereas the palm below or the fingers half closed
means “take.” Whatever the choice, it must be adhered to; the
standardized, conventional element has entered. That is why
one customarily speaks of “systems” of writing. Without the
system, there can be not even picture-writing, but only pictures,
whose range of power of communication is far more limited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>When the phonetic phase begins to be entered, conventionalization
of meaning is even more important. An inn must be
distinguished from a house by its shield, a house from a barn
by its chimney, and so on. The shield will perhaps have to be
exaggerated to be visible at all, be heart-shaped or circular to
distinguish it from windows; and so forth. So with the phonetic
values. A syllable like English “per” might be represented by
one scribe by means of a cat with a wavy line issuing from its
mouth to denote its <i>purr</i>; by another by a <i>pear</i>; by a third, by
something that habitually came as a <i>pair</i>, such as earrings.
Any of these combined with a “sieve” symbol would approximately
render the work “per-ceive.” But some one else might
hit upon the combination of a <i>purse</i> and the setting sun at <i>eve</i>.
Obviously there has got to be a concordance of method if any
one but the writer is to read his inscription readily. This correspondence
of representation and interpretation is precisely
what constitutes a set of figures into a system of writing instead
of a puzzle.</p>

<h3 id="section133">133. <span class="smcap">Presumptive Origins of Mixed Systems</span></h3>

<p>For such a set concordance to grow up among all the diverse
classes of one large nation would be very difficult. In fact, it
seems that transitional systems of writing have originated among
small groups with common business or purpose, whose members
were in touch with one another, and perhaps sufficiently provided
with leisure to experiment: colleges of priests, government
archivists, possibly merchants with accounts. It is also clear
that any system must reflect the culture of the people among
whom it originates. The ancient Egyptians had no inns nor
purses, but did have horned serpents and owls. Still more determining
is the influence of the language itself, as soon as
writing attempts to be phonetic. The words expressing pair
and sieve are obviously something else in Egyptian than in English,
so that if these signs were used, their sound value would
be quite otherwise. Yet once a system has crystallized, there
is nothing to prevent a new nationality from taking it over
bodily. The picture values of the signs can be wholly disregarded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
and their sounds read for words of a different meaning;
or the sounds could be disregarded, or the original proper forms
of the characters be pretty well obliterated, but their idea value
carried over into the other tongue. Thus the Semitic Babylonians
took the Cuneiform writing from the Sumerians, whose
speech was distinct.</p>

<p>It is also well to distinguish between such cases of the whole
or most of a system being taken over bodily, and other instances
in which one people may have derived the generic idea of the
method of writing from another and then worked out a system
of its own. Thus it is hard not to believe in some sort of connection
of stimulus between Egyptian and Cuneiform writing
because they originated in the same part of the world almost
simultaneously. Yet both the forms of the characters and their
meaning and sound values differ so thoroughly in Egyptian and
Cuneiform that no specific connection between them has been
demonstrated, and it seems unlikely that one is a modified derivative
form of the other. So with the hieroglyphs of the
Hittites and Cretans. They appeared in near-by regions somewhat
later. Consequently, although their forms are distinctive
and, so far as can be judged without our being able to read
these systems, their values also, it would be dogmatic to assert
that the development of these two writings took place without
any stimulation from Egyptian or Cuneiform. Something of
a similar argument would perhaps apply even to Chinese
(§ <a href="#section251">251</a>), though on this point extreme caution is necessary. Accordingly
if one thinks of the invention of the first idea of part-phonetic
writing, it is conceivable that all the ancient systems
of the Old World derive from a single such invention; although
even in that event the Maya-Aztec system would remain as a
wholly separate growth. If on the other hand one has in mind
the content and specific manner of systems of the transitional
type, Egyptian, Cuneiform, and Chinese, perhaps also Cretan
and Hittite, are certainly distinct and constitute so many instances
of parallelism. Even greater is the number of independent
starts if one considers pure pictographic systems, since
tolerable beginnings of this type were made by the Indians of
the United States, who never even attempted sound representations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<h3 id="section134">134. <span class="smcap">Phonetic Writing: the Primitive Semitic Alphabet</span></h3>

<p>The last basic invention was that of purely phonetic writing—the
expressing only of sounds, without admixture of pictures
or symbols. Perhaps the most significant fact about this method
as distinguished from earlier forms of writing is that it was
invented only once in history. All the alphabetic systems which
now prevail in nearly every part of the earth—Roman, Greek,
Hebrew, Arabic, Indian, as well as many that have become extinct—can
be traced back to a single source. The story in this
case is therefore one of diffusion and modification instead of
parallelism.</p>

<p>What circumstance it was that caused this all-important invention
to be made, is not known, unfortunately, though time
may yet bring knowledge. There is even division of opinion
as to the particular system of mixed writing that was drawn
upon by the first devisers of the alphabet, or that served as
jumping off place for the invention. Some have looked to the
Egyptian system, others to a Cuneiform or Cretan or Hittite
source of inspiration. Nor is it wholly clear who were the precise
people responsible for the invention. It is only certain that
about 1,000 B.C., or a little earlier, some Semitic people of
western Asia, in the region of the Hebrews and Phœnicians,
probably the latter themselves, began to use a set of twenty-two
non-pictorial characters that stood for nothing but sounds.
Moreover, they represented the sounds of Semitic with sufficient
accuracy for anything in the language to be written and read
without trouble. These twenty-two letters look simple and insignificant
alongside the numerous, beautiful, and interesting
Egyptian hieroglyphs. But on them is based every form of
alphabet ever used by humanity.</p>

<p>The earliest extant example of the primitive Semitic alphabet<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
is on the famous Moabite Stone of King Mesha, who in the ninth
century before Christ erected and inscribed this monument to
commemorate the successful defense of Moab against the invading
Hebrews. Now Moab was a little and rude country, somewhat
off the roads of commerce and civilization. It is hardly likely,
therefore, that the Moabites were the inventors of the alphabet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
It is much more probable that the system was perfected, perhaps
several centuries earlier, by a wealthier and more important
people, one more in contact with foreign nations, such as
the Phœnicians, and that from them it spread to their neighbors,
the Hebrews, Moabites, and Aramæans of Syria. This spread
must have been facilitated by the close kinship of the speech of
these nations, enabling any of them to adopt the alphabet of
another without material modification.</p>

<p>The Phœnicians founded Carthage, and consequently the
Carthaginian or Punic writing until after the extinction of the
great trading city was also Phœnician.</p>

<h3 id="section135">135. <span class="smcap">The Greek Alphabet: Invention of the Vowels</span></h3>

<p>More important was the spread of the Phœnician letters to an
entirely foreign people, the Greeks, whose language was largely
composed of different sounds and possessed a genius distinct
from that of the Semitic tongues. The Greeks’ own traditions
attest that they took over their alphabet from the Phœnicians.
The fact of the transmission is corroborated by the form of the
letters and by their order in the alphabet. It is also proved
very prettily by the names of the letters. As we speak of the
ABC, the Greeks spoke of the Alpha Beta—whence our word
“alphabet.” Now “alpha” and “beta” mean nothing in Greek.
They are obviously foreign names. In the Semitic languages,
however, similar names, Aleph and Beth, were used for the same
letters A and B, and meant respectively “ox” and “house.”
Evidently these names were applied by the Semites because they
employed the picture of an ox head to represent the first sound
in the word Aleph, and the representation of a house to represent
the sound of B in Beth. Or possibly the letters originated
in some other way, and then, names for them being felt to be
desirable, and the shape of the first rudely suggesting the outline
of an ox’s head and the second a house, these names were
applied to the characters already in use.</p>

<p>The third letter of the alphabet, corresponding in place to
our C and in sound to our G, the Greeks called Gamma, which
is as meaningless as their Alpha and Beta. It is their corruption
of Semitic Gimel, which means “camel” and may bear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
this name because of its resemblance to the head and neck of a
camel. The same sort of correspondence can be traced through
most of the remaining letters. From these names alone, then,
even if nothing else were known about the early alphabets, it
would be possible to prove the correctness of the Greek legend
that they derived their letters from the Phœnicians. A people
who themselves invented an alphabet would obviously name the
letters with words in their own language, and not with meaningless
syllables taken from a foreign speech.</p>

<p>The Greeks however did more than take over the alphabet
from the Phœnicians. They improved it. An outstanding
peculiarity of Semitic writing was that it dispensed with vowels.
It represented the consonants fully and accurately, in fact had
carefully devised letters for a number of breath and guttural
sounds which European languages either do not contain or generally
neglect to recognize. But, as if to compensate, the Semitic
languages possess the distinctive trait of a great variability of
vowels. When a verb is conjugated, when it is converted into a
noun, and in other circumstances, the vowels change, only the
consonants remaining the same, much as in English “sing” becomes
“sang” in the past and “goose” changes to “geese” in
the plural. Only, in English such changes are comparatively
few, whereas in Semitic they are the overwhelming rule and
quite intricate. The result of this fluidity of the vowels was
that when the Semites invented their letters they renounced the
attempt to write the vowels. Apparently they felt the consonants,
the only permanent portions of their words, as a sort of
skeleton, sufficient for an unmistakable outline. So, with their
ordinary consonants, plus letters for J and V which at need
could be made to stand for I and U, and the consistent employment
of breaths and stops to indicate the presence or absence
of vowels at the beginning and end of words, they managed to
make their writing readily legible. It was as if we should write:
<i>’n Gd w’ trst</i> or <i>Ths wy ’t</i>. Even to-day the Bible is written
and read in the Jewish synagogue by this vowelless system of
three thousand years ago.</p>

<p>In the Greek language more confusion would have been caused
by this system. Moreover, the alphabet came to the Greeks as
something extraneous, so that they were not under the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
temptation as the Phœnicians to follow wholly in the footsteps
of the first generation of inventors. As a result, the Greeks
took the novel step of adding vowel letters.</p>

<p>It is significant that what the Greeks did was not to make
the new vowel signs out of whole cloth, as it were, out of nothing,
but that they followed the method which is characteristic
of invention in general. They took over the existing system,
twisted and stretched it as far as they could, and created outright
only when they were forced to. While the Phœnician
alphabet lacked vowel signs, the Greeks felt that it had a superfluity
of signs for breaths and stops. So they transformed the
Semitic breaths and stops into vowels. Thus they satisfied the
needs of their language; and incidentally added the capstone
to the alphabet. It was the first time that a system of writing
had been brought on the complete basis of a letter for every
sound. All subsequent European alphabets are merely modifications
of the Greek one.</p>

<p>The first of the Semitic letters, the Aleph, stood for the glottal
stop, a check or closure of the glottis in which the vocal cords
are situated; a sound that occurs, although feebly, between the
two o’s in “coördinate” when one articulates distinctly. In the
Semitic languages this glottal stop is frequent, vigorous, and
etymologically important, wherefore the Semites treated it like
any other consonant. The Greeks gave it a new value, that of
the vowel A. Similarly they transformed the value of the symbols
for two breath sounds, a mild and a harsh H, into short and
long E, which they called Epsilon and Eta. Their O is made
over from a Semitic guttural letter, while for I the Semitic
ambiguous J-I was ready to hand. U, written Y by the Greeks,
is a dissimilated variant of F, both being derived from Semitic
Vau or the sixth letter with the value of V or U. The vocalic
form was now put at the end of the alphabet, which previously
had ended with T. Its consonantal double, F, later went out of
use in Greek speech and was dropped from the alphabet.</p>

<h3 id="section136">136. <span class="smcap">Slowness of the Invention</span></h3>

<p>The Greeks did not make these alterations of value all at once.
The value of several of the letters fluctuated in the different<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
parts of Greece for two or three centuries. In one city a certain
value or form of a letter would come into usage; in another,
the same letter would be shaped differently, or stand for a consonant
instead of a vowel. Thus the character H was long read
by some of the Greeks as H, by others as long E. This fact
illustrates the principle that the Greek alphabet was not an invention
which leaped, complete and perfect, out of the brain of
an individual genius, as inventions do in film plays and romantic
novels, and as the popular mind, with its instinct for the dramatic,
likes to believe. One might imagine that with the basic
plan of the alphabet, and the majority of its symbols, provided
ready-made by the Phœnicians, it would have been a simple
matter for a single Greek to add the finishing touches and so
shape his national system of writing as it has come down to us.
In fact, however, these little finishing touches were several centuries
in the making; the final result was a compromise between
all sorts of experiments and beginnings. One can picture an
entire nationality literally groping for generation after generation,
and only slowly settling on the ultimate system. There
must have been dozens of innovators who tried their hand at a
modification of the value or form of a letter.</p>

<p>Nor can it be denied that what was new in the Greek alphabet
was a true invention. The step of introducing full vowel characters
was as definitely original and almost as important as any
new progress in the history of civilization. Yet it is not even
known who the first individual was that tried to apply this idea.
Tradition is silent on the point. It is quite conceivable that the
first writing of vowels may have been independently attempted
by a number of individuals in different parts of Greece.</p>

<h3 id="section137">137. <span class="smcap">The Roman Alphabet</span></h3>

<p>The Roman alphabet was derived from the Greek. But it is
clear that it was not taken from the Greek alphabet after this
had reached its final or classic form. If such had been the case,
the Roman letters, such as we still use them, would undoubtedly
be more similar to the Greek ones than they are, and certain
discrepancies in the values of the letters, as well as in their
order, would not have occurred. In the old days of writing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
when a number of competing forms of the alphabet still flourished
in the several Greek cities, one of these forms, developed
at Chalcis on Eubœa and allied on the whole to those of the
Western Hellenic world, was carried to Italy. There, after a
further course of local diversification, one of its subvarieties became
fixed in the usage of the inhabitants of the city of Rome.
Now the Romans at this period still pronounced the sound H,
which later became feeble in the Latin tongue and finally died
out. On the other hand the distinction between short and long
(or close and open) E, which the Greeks after many experiments
came to recognize as important in their speech, was of no great
moment in Latin. The result was that whereas classic Greek
turned both the Semitic H’s into E’s, Latin accepted only the
first of these modifications, that one affecting the fifth letter of
the alphabet, whereas the other H, occupying the eighth place
in the alphabetic series, continued to be used by the Romans
with approximately its original Semitic value. This retention,
however, was possible because Greek writing was still in a transitional,
vacillating stage when it reached the Romans. The
Western Greek form of the alphabet that was carried to Italy
was still using the eighth letter as an H; so that the Romans
were merely following their teachers. Had they based their
letters on the “classic” Greek alphabet which was standardized
a few hundred years later, the eighth as well as the fifth letter
would have come to them with its vowel value crystallized. In
that case the Romans would either have dispensed altogether
with writing H, or would have invented a totally new sign for
it and probably tacked it on to the end of the alphabet, as both
they and the Greeks did in the case of several other letters.</p>

<p>The net result is the curious one that whereas the Roman
alphabet is derived from the Greek, and therefore subsequent,
it remains, in this particular matter of the eighth letter, nearer
to the original Semitic alphabet.</p>

<p>There are other letters in the Roman alphabet which corroborate
the fact of its being modeled on a system of the period
when Greek writing still remained under the direct influence
of Phœnician. The Semitic languages possessed two K sounds,
usually called Kaph and Koph, or K and Q, of which the former
was pronounced much like our K and the latter farther back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
toward the throat. The Greeks not having both these sounds
kept the letter Kaph, which they called Kappa, and gradually
discarded Koph or Koppa. Yet before its meaning had become
entirely lost, they had carried it to Italy. There the Romans
seized upon it to designate a variety of K which the Greek dialects
did not possess, namely KW; which is of course the
phonetic value which the symbol Q still has in English. The
Romans were reasonable in this procedure, for in early Latin
the Q was produced with the extreme rear of the tongue, much
like the original Koph.</p>

<h3 id="section138">138. <span class="smcap">Letters as Numeral Signs</span></h3>

<p>In later Greek, Koph remained only as a curious survival.
Although not used as a letter, it was a number symbol. None
of the ancients possessed pure numeral symbols of the type of
our “Arabic” ones. The Semites and the Greeks employed the
letters of the alphabet for this purpose, each letter having a
numeral value dependent on its place in the alphabet. Thus
A stood for 1, B for 2, C or Gamma for 3, F for 6, I for 10,
K for 20 and so on. As this series became established, Q as
a numeral denoted 90; the Greeks, long after they had ceased
writing Q as a letter, used it with this arithmetical value. Once
it had acquired a place in the series, it would have been far too
confusing to drop. With Q omitted, R would have had to be
shifted in its value from 100 to 90. One man would have continued
to use R with its old value, while his more new-fashioned
neighbor or son would have written it to denote ten less. Arithmetic
would have been as thoroughly wrecked as if we should
decide to drop out the figure 5 and write 6 whenever we meant
5, 7 to express 6, and so on. Habit in such cases is insuperable.
No matter how awkward an established system becomes, it normally
remains more practical to retain with its deficiencies than
to replace by a better scheme. The wrench and cost of reformation
are greater, or are felt to be greater by each generation,
than the advantages to be gained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<h3 id="section139">139. <span class="smcap">Reform in Institutions</span></h3>

<p>This is one reason why radical changes are so difficult to bring
about in institutions. These are social and therefore in a sense
arbitrary. In mechanical or “practical” matters people adjust
themselves to the pressure of new conditions more quickly. If
a nation has been in the habit of wearing clothing of wool, and
this material becomes scarce and expensive, some attempt will
indeed be made to increase the supply of wool, but if production
fails to keep pace with the deficiency, cotton is substituted
with little reluctance. If, on the other hand, a calendar becomes
antiquated, which could be changed by a simple act of will, by
the mere exercise of community reason, a tremendous resistance
is encountered. Time and again nations have gone on with an
antiquated or cumbersome calendar long after any mediocre
mathematician or astronomer could have devised a better one.
It is usually reserved for an autocratic potentate of undisputed
authority, a Cæsar or a Pope, or for a cataclysm like the French
and Russian revolutions, to institute the needed reform. As
long as men are concerned with their bodily wants, those which
they share with the lower animals, they appear sensible and
adaptable. In proportion however as the alleged products of
their intellects are involved, when one might most expect foresight
and reason and cool calculation to be influential, societies
seem swayed by a conservatism and stubbornness the
strength of which looms greater as we examine history more
deeply.</p>

<p>Of course, each nation and generation regards itself as the
one exception. But irrationality is as easy to discern in modern
institutions as in ancient alphabets, if one has a mind to see it.
Daylight saving is an example very near home. For centuries
the peoples of western civilization have gradually got out of
bed, breakfasted, worked, dined, and gone to sleep later and
later, until the middle of their waking day came at about two
or three o’clock instead of noon. The beginning of the natural
day was being spent in sleep, most relaxation taken at night.
This was not from deliberate preference, but from a species of
procrastination of which the majority were unintentionally
guilty. Finally the wastefulness of the condition became evident.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
Every one was actually paying money for illumination
which enabled him to sit in a room while he might have been
amusing himself gratis outdoors. Really rational beings would
have changed their habits—blown the factory whistle at seven
instead of eight, opened the office at eight instead of nine, gone
to the theater at seven and to bed at ten. But the herd impulse
was too strong. The individual that departed from the custom
of the mass would have been made to suffer. The first theater
opening at seven would have played to empty chairs. The office
closing at four would have lost the business of the last hour of
the day without compensation from the empty hour prefixed at
the beginning. The only way out was for every one to agree to
a self-imposed fiction. So the nations that prided themselves
most on their intelligence solemnly enacted that all clocks be set
ahead. Next morning, every one had cheated himself into an
hour of additional daylight, and the illuminating plant out of
an hour of revenue, without any one having had to depart from
established custom; which last was evidently the course actually
to be avoided at all hazards.</p>

<p>Of course, most individual men and women are neither idiotic
nor insane. The only conclusion is that as soon and as long
as people live in relations and act in groups, something wholly
irrational is imposed on them, something that is inherent in the
very nature of society and civilization. There appears to be
little or nothing that the individual can do in regard to this
force except to refrain from adding to its irrationality the delusion
that it is rational.</p>

<h3 id="section140">140. <span class="smcap">The Sixth and Seventh Letters</span></h3>

<p>The letters, such as Q, in which the Roman alphabet is in
agreement with the original Semitic one and differs from
classic Greek writing, might lead, if taken by themselves, to the
conjecture that the ancient Italians had perhaps not derived
their alphabet via the Greeks at all, but directly from the Phœnicians.
But this conclusion is untenable: first, because the
forms of the earliest Latin and Greek letters are on the whole
more similar to each other than to the contemporaneous Semitic
forms; and second because of the deviations from the Semitic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
prototype which the Latin and Greek systems share with each
other, as in the vowels.</p>

<p>The sixth letter of the Roman alphabet, F, the Semitic Waw
or Vau, is wanting in classic Greek, although retained in certain
early and provincial dialects. One of the brilliant discoveries
of classical philology was that the speech in which the Homeric
poems were originally composed still possessed this sound, numerous
irregularities of scansion being explainable only on the
basis of its original presence. The letter for it looked like two
Greek G’s, one set on top of the other. Hence, later when it
had long gone out of use except as a numeral, it was called
Di-gamma or “double-G.”</p>

<p>The seventh Semitic letter, which in Greek finally became the
sixth on account of the loss of the Vau or Digamma, was Zayin,
Greek Zeta, our Z. This, in turn, the Romans omitted, because
their language lacked the sound. They filled its place with G,
which in Phœnician and Greek came in third position. The
shift came about thus. The earliest Italic writing followed the
Semitic and Greek original and had C, pronounced G, as its
third letter. But in Etruscan the sounds K and G were hardly
distinguished. K therefore went out of use; and the early Romans
followed the precedent of their cultured and influential
Etruscan neighbors. For a time, therefore, the single character
C was employed for both G and K in Latin. Finally, about the
third century before Christ, a differentiation being found desirable,
the C was written as C when it stood for the “hard”
or voiceless sound K, but with a small stroke, as G, when it represented
the soft or voiced sound; and, the seventh place in the
alphabet, that of Z, being vacant, this modified character was
inserted. Thus original C, pronounced G, was split by the
Latins into two similar letters, one retaining the shape and
place in the alphabet of Gimel-Gamma, the other retaining the
sound of Gamma but displacing Zeta.</p>

<p>But the letter Z did not remain permanently eliminated from
western writing. As long as the Romans continued rude and
self-sufficient, they had no need of a character for a sound
which they did not speak. When they became powerful, expanded,
touched Greek civilization, and borrowed from this its
literature, philosophy, and arts, they took over also many Greek<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
names and words. As Z occurred in these, they adopted the
character. Yet to have put it in its original seventh place which
was now occupied by G, would have disturbed the position of
the following letters. It was obviously more convenient to hang
this once rejected and now reinstated character on at the end
of the alphabet; and there it is now.</p>

<h3 id="section141">141. <span class="smcap">The Tail of the Alphabet</span></h3>

<p>In fact, the last six letters of our alphabet are additions of
this sort. The original Semitic alphabet ended with T. U was
differentiated by the Greeks from F to provide for one of their
vowel sounds. This addition was made at an early enough
period to be communicated to the Romans. This nation wrote
U both for the vowel U and the consonantal or semi-vowel sound
of our W. To be exact, they did not write U at all, but what
we should call V, pronouncing it sometimes U and sometimes W.
They spelled <i>cvm</i>, not <i>cum</i>.</p>

<p>Later, they added X. An old Semitic S-sound, in fifteenth
place in the alphabet and distinct from the S in twenty-first
position which is the original of our S, was used for both SS
and KS. In classic Greek, one form, with KS value, maintained
itself in its original place. In other early Græco-Italic alphabets,
the second form, with SS value, kept fifteenth place and
the X or KS variant was put at the end, after U. The SS letter
later dropped out because it was not distinguished in pronunciation
from S.</p>

<p>The Y that follows X is intrinsically nothing but the U which
the Romans already had—a sort of double of it. The Greek U
however was pronounced differently from the Latin one—like
French U or German ü. The literary Roman felt that he could
not adequately represent it in Greek words by his own U. He
therefore took over the U as the Greeks wrote it—that is, a reduced
V on top of a vertical stroke. This character naturally
came to be known as Greek U; and in modern French Y is not
simply called “Y,” as in English, but “Y-grec,” that is,
“Greek Y.”</p>

<p>With Z added to U (V), X, and Y, the ancient Roman
alphabet was completed.</p>

<p>Our modern Roman alphabet is however still fuller. The two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
values which V had in Latin, that of the vowel U and the semi-vowel
W, are so similar that no particular hardship was caused
through their representation by the one character. But in the
development of Latin from the classic period to mediæval times,
the semi-vowel sound W came to be pronounced as the consonant
V as we speak it in English. This change occurred both
in Latin in its survival as a religious and literary tongue, and
in the popularly spoken Romance languages, like French and
Italian, that sprang out of Latin. Finally it was felt that the
full vowel U and the pure consonant V were so different that
separate letters for them would be convenient. The two forms
with rounded and pointed bottom were already actually in use
as mere calligraphic variants, although not distinguished in
sound, V being usually written at the beginning of words, U
in the middle. Not until after the tenth century did the custom
slowly and undesignedly take root of using the pointed letter
exclusively for the consonant, which happened to come most frequently
at the head of words, and the rounded letter for the
vowel which was commoner medially.</p>

<p>In the same way I and J were originally one letter. In the
original Semitic this stood for the semi-vowel J (or “Y” as in
yet); in Greek for the vowel I; in Latin indifferently for vowel
or semi-vowel, as in Ianuarius. Later, however, in English,
French, and Spanish speech, the semi-vowel became a consonant
just as V had become. When differentiation between I as vowel
and as consonant seemed necessary, it was effected by seizing
upon a distinction in form which had originated merely as a
calligraphic flourish. About the fifteenth century, I was given
a round turn to the left, when at the beginning of words, as an
ornamental initial. The distinction in sound value came still
later. The forms I and J were kept together in the alphabet,
as U and V had been, the juxtaposition serving as a memento
of their recency of distinction—like the useless dot over small j.
Had the people of the Middle Ages still been using the letters
of the alphabet for numerical figures as did the Greeks, they
would undoubtedly have found it more convenient to keep the
order of the old letters intact. J and U would in that case
almost certainly have been put at the end of the alphabet instead
of adjacent to I and V.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>J presents a survival—a significant anachronism. Although
now recognized in the alphabet, the letter is not always accorded
its full place in the series; now and then it is treated like an
adopted child whose position in the family is somewhat subsidiary.
When a continental European uses letters to designate
rows of chairs in a theater, paragraph headings in a book, a
series of shipping marks, or any other listing, he often omits J,
passing directly from I to K as a Roman of two thousand years
ago would have done. Americans occasionally do the same: in
Washington, K street follows directly on I street. If asked the
reason, we perhaps rationalize the omission on the ground that
I and J look so much alike that they run risk of being confused.
Yet it scarcely occurs to us that I and L, or I and T, can also
be easily confused. The true cause of the habit seems to be the
unconscious one that our ancestors, in using the letters seriatim,
followed I by K because they had no J.</p>

<p>The origin of W is accounted for by its name, “Double-U,”
and by its form, which is that of two V’s. The old Latin pronunciation
of V gradually changed from W to V, and many of
the later European languages either contained no W-sound or
indicated it by the device of writing U or some combination into
which U entered. Thus the French write OU and the Spanish
HU for the sound of W. In English, however, and in a few
other European languages, the semi-vowel sound was important
enough to make a less circumstantial representation advisable.
Since the sound of the semi-vowel was felt to be fuller than that
of the consonant, a new letter was coined for the former by
coupling together two of the latter. This innovation did not
begin to creep into English until the eleventh century. Being
an outgrowth of U and V, W was inserted after them as J was
after I. It is a slight but interesting instance of convergence
that its name is exactly parallel to the name “Double Gamma”
which the Greek grammarians coined for F long before.</p>

<h3 id="section142">142. <span class="smcap">Capitals and Minuscules</span></h3>

<p>The distinction between capitals and “small” letters is one
which we learn so early in life that we are wont to take it as
something self-evident and natural. Yet it is a late addition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
in the history of the alphabet. Greeks and Romans knew nothing
of it. They wrote wholly in what we should call capital
letters. If they wanted a title or heading to stand out, they
made the letters larger, but not different in form. The same is
done to-day in Hebrew and Arabic, and in fact in all alphabets
except those of Europe.</p>

<p>Our own two kinds or fonts of letters, the capital and “lower
case” or “minuscule,” are more different than we ordinarily
realize. We have seen them both so often in the same words
that we are likely to forget that the “A” differs even more in
form than in size from “a,” and that “b” has wholly lost the
upper of the two loops which mark “B.” In late Imperial
Roman times the original “capital” forms of the letters were
retained for inscriptional purposes, but in ordinary writing
changes began to creep in. These modifications increased in the
Middle Ages, giving rise first to the “Uncial” and then to the
“Minuscule” forms of the letters. Both represent a cursive
rather than a formal script. The minuscules are essentially the
modern “small” letters. But when they first developed, people
wrote wholly in them, reserving the older formal capitals for
chapter initials. Later, the capitals crept out of their temporary
rarity and came to head paragraphs, sentences, proper names,
and in fact all words that seemed important. Even as late as a
few centuries ago, every English noun was written and printed
with a capital letter, as it still is in German. Of course little or
nothing was gained by this procedure. In many sentences the
significant word must be a verb or adjective; and yet, according
to the arbitrary old rule, it was the noun that was made to
stand out.</p>

<p>To-day we still feel it necessary in English to retain capitals
for proper names. It is certain that a suggestion to commence
these also with small letters would be met with the objection
that a loss of clearness would be entailed. As a matter of fact,
the cases in which ambiguity between a common and proper
noun might ensue would be exceedingly few; the occasional inconvenience
so caused would be more than compensated for by
increased simplicity of writing and printing. Every child
would learn its letters in little more than half the time that it
requires now. The printer would be able to operate with half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
as many characters, and typewriting machines could dispense
with a shift key. French and Spanish designate proper adjectives
without capitals and encounter no misunderstanding, and
all English telegrams are sent in a code that makes no distinction.
When we read the newspaper in the morning and think
that the mixture of capital and small letters is necessary for
our easy comprehension of the page, we forget that this same
news came over the wire without capitals.</p>

<h3 id="section143">143. <span class="smcap">Conservatism and Rationalization</span></h3>

<p>The fact is that we have become so habituated to the existing
method that a departure from it might temporarily be a bit
disconcerting. Consequently we rationalize our cumbersome
habit, taking for granted or explaining that this custom is intrinsically
and logically best; although a moments objective
reflection suffices to show that the system we are so addicted
to costs each of us, and will cost the next generation, time,
energy, and money without bringing substantial compensation.</p>

<p>It is true that this waste is distributed through our lives in
small driblets, and therefore is something that can be borne
without seeming inconvenience. Civilization undoubtedly can
continue to thrive even while it adheres to the antiquated and
jumbling method of mixing two kinds of letters where one is
sufficient. Yet the practice illustrates the principle that the
most civilized as the most savage nations assert and believe that
they adhere to their institutions after an impartial consideration
of all alternatives and in full exercise of wisdom, whereas
analysis regularly reveals them as astonishingly resistive to
alteration whether for better or worse.</p>

<p>If our capital letters had been purposely superadded to the
small ones as a means of distinguishing certain kinds of words,
a modern claim that they were needed for this purpose could
perhaps be accepted. But since the history of the alphabet shows
that the capital letters are the earlier ones, that the small letters
were for centuries used alone, and that systems of writing have
operated and operate without the distinction, it is clear that
utility cannot be the true motive. The employment of capital
letters as initials originated in a desire for ornamentation. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
is an embroidery, the result of a play of the æsthetic sense. It
is the use of capitals that has caused the false sense of their
need, not necessity that has led to their use.</p>

<h3 id="section144">144. <span class="smcap">Gothic</span></h3>

<p>Another exemplification of how tenaciously men cling to the
accustomed at the expense of efficiency, is provided by the
“Black-Letter” or “Gothic” alphabet used in Germany and
Scandinavia. This is nothing but the Roman letters as elaborated
by the manuscript-copying monks of northern Europe
toward the end of the Middle Ages, when a book was as much
a work of art as a volume of reading matter. The sharp angles,
double connecting strokes, goose-quill flourishes, and other increments
of the Gothic letters undoubtedly possess a decorative
effect, although an over-elaborate one. They were evolved in a
period when a copyist cheerfully lettered for a year in producing
a volume, and the lord or bishop into whose hands it
passed was as likely to turn the leaves in admiration of the
black and red characters as to spend time in reading them.</p>

<p>When printing was introduced, the first types were the intricate
and angular Gothic ones customary in Germany. The
Italians, who had always been half-hearted about the Gothic
forms, soon revolted. Under the influence of the Renaissance
and its renewed inspiration from classical antiquity, they reverted
as far as possible to the ancient shapes of the characters.
Even the mediæval small letters were simplified and rounded as
much as possible to bring them into accord with the old Roman
style. From Italy these types spread to France and most other
European countries, including England, which for the first
fifty years had printed in Black-Letter. Only in north central
Europe did the Gothic forms continue to prevail, although even
there all scientific books have for some time been printed in the
Roman alphabet. Yet Germans sometimes complain of the
“difficulty” of the Roman letters, and books intended for
popular sale, and newspapers, go into Gothic. There can be
little doubt that in time the Roman letters will dispossess the
Gothic ones in Germany and Scandinavia except for ornamental
display heads. But the established ways die hard; Gothic letters
may linger on as the “old-style” calendar with its eleven-day
belatedness held out in England until 1752 and in Russia
until 1917.</p>

<p>Only a small part of the history of the alphabet was unfolded
in Europe, where the seemingly so different forms of writing
that have been discussed are after all only fairly close variants
of the early Greek letters. In Asia the alphabet underwent
more profound changes.</p>

<p>The chief modern Semitic alphabets, Hebrew and Arabic, are
considerably more altered from the primitive Semitic or Phœnician
than is our own alphabet. The Hebrew letters were slowly
evolved, during the first ten centuries after Christ, under influences
which have turned most of them as nearly as possible
into parts of squarish boxes. B and K, M and S, G and N, H
and CH and T, D and V and Z and R are shaped as if with
intent to look alike rather than different. Arabic, on the other
hand, runs wholly to curves: circles, segments of circles, and
round flourishes; and several of its letters have become identical
except for diacritical marks. If we put side by side the
corresponding primitive Semitic, the modern English, the Hebrew,
and the Arabic letters, it is at once apparent that in most
cases English observes most faithfully the 3,000-years old forms.
The cause of these changes in Hebrew and Arabic is in the main
their derivation from alphabets descended from the Aramæan
alphabet, a form of script that grew up during the seventh century
B.C. in Aram to the northeast of Phœnicia. The Aramæans
were Semites and therefore kept to the original value of the
Phœnician letters more closely than the Greeks and Romans. On
the other hand, they employed the alphabet primarily for business
purposes and rapidly altered it to a cursive form, in which
the looped or enclosing letters like A, B, D were opened and
the way was cleared for a series of increasing modifications.
Greek and Roman writing, on the other hand, were at first used
largely in monumental, dedicatory, legal, and religious connections,
and preserved clarity of form at the expense of rapidity
of production.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>One feature of primitive Semitic, most Asiatic alphabets retained
for a long time: the lack of vowel signs. In the end,
however, representation of the vowels proved to be so advantageous
that it was introduced. Yet the later Semites did not
follow the Greek example of converting dispensable consonantal
signs into vocalic ones. They continued to recognize consonant
signs as the only real letters, and then added smaller marks, or
“points” as they are called, for the vowels. These points correspond
more or less to the grave, acute, and circumflex accents
which French uses to distinguish vowel shades or qualities, é, è,
ê, and e, for instance; and to the double dot or diæresis which
German puts upon its “umlaut” vowels, as to distinguish ä
(= e) from a. There is this difference, however: whereas European
points are reserved for minor modifications, Hebrew and
Arabic have no other means of representing vowels than these
points. The vowels therefore remain definitely subsidiary to the
consonants; to the extent of this deficiency Hebrew has adhered
more closely to the primitive Semitic system than have we.</p>

<p>The reason for this difference lies probably in the fact that
Hebrew and Arabic have retained virtually all the consonants
of ancient Semitic. Hence the breaths and stops could not be
dispensed with, or at least such was the feeling of their speakers.
In the Indo-European languages, these sounds being wanting,
the transformation of the superfluous signs into the letters
needed for the vowels was suggested to the Greeks. The step
perfecting the alphabet was therefore taken by them not so much
because they possessed originality or specially fertile imagination,
as because of the accident that their speech consisted of
sounds considerably different from those of Semitic. Perhaps
the Greeks once complained of the unfitness of the Phœnician
alphabet, and adjusted it to their language with grumblings.
Had they been able to take it over unmodified, as the Hebrews
and Arabs were able, it is probable that they would cheerfully
have done so with all its imperfection. In that case they, and
after them the Romans, and perhaps we too, would very likely
have gone on writing only consonants as full letters and representing
vowels by the Semitic method of subsidiary points. In
short, even so enterprising and innovating a people as the Greeks
are generally reputed to have been, made their important contribution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
to the alphabet less because they wished to improve it
than because an accident of phonetics led them to find the
means. Such are the marvels of human invention when divested
of their romantic halo and examined objectively.</p>

<h3 id="section146">146. <span class="smcap">The Spread Eastward: the Writing of India</span></h3>

<p>The diffusion of the alphabet eastward from its point of origin
was even greater than its spread through Europe. Most of this
extension in Asia is comprised in two great streams. One of
these followed the southern edge of the continent. This was a
movement that began some centuries before Christ, and often
followed water routes. The second flow was mainly post-Christian
and affected chiefly the inland peoples of central Asia.</p>

<p>India is the country of most importance in the development
of the south Asiatic alphabets. The forms of the Sanskrit letters
show that they and the subsequent Hindu alphabets are derivatives,
though much altered ones, from the primitive Semitic
writing. Exactly how the alphabet was carried from the shore
of the Mediterranean to India has not been fully determined.
By some the prototype of the principal earliest Indian form of
writing is thought to have been the alphabet of the south Arabian
Sabæans or Himyarites of five or six hundred years B.C. As
the Arabs were Semites, and as there was a certain amount of
commerce up and down the Red Sea, it is not surprising that
even these rather remote and backward people had taken up
writing. Between south Arabia and India there was also some
intercourse, so that a further transmission by sea seems possible
enough. Another view is that Hindu traders learned and imported
a north Semitic alphabet perhaps as early as during the
seventh century, from which the Brahmi was made over, from
which in turn all living Indian alphabets are derived. Besides
this main importation, there was another, from Aramæan
sources, which gave rise to a different form of Hindu writing,
the Kharoshthi or Indo-Bactrian of the Punjab, which spread
for a time into Turkistan but soon died out in India.</p>

<h3 id="section147">147. <span class="smcap">Syllabic Tendencies</span></h3>

<p>One trait of Indian alphabets leads back to their direct
Semitic origin: they did not recognize the vowels. The Hindus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
speaking Indo-European were confronted with the same difficulty
as the Greeks when they took over the vowelless Semitic
alphabet. But they solved the difficulty in their own way. They
assumed that a consonantal letter stood for a consonant plus a
vowel. Thus, each letter was really the sign for a syllable. The
most common vowel in Sanskrit being A, this was assumed
as being inherent in the consonant. For instance, their letter
for K was not read K, but KA. This meant that when K was
to be read merely as K, it had to be specially designated: something
had to be done to take away the vowel A. A diacritical
sign was added, known as the virama. This negative sign is a
“point” just as much as the positive vowel points of Hebrew;
but was used to denote exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>There are of course other vowels than A in Sanskrit. These
were represented by diacritical marks analogous to the virama.
Thus while this is a diagonal stroke below the consonant, U is
represented by a small curve below, E by a backward curve
above, AI by two such, and so on.</p>

<p>If a syllable had two consonants before the vowel, these were
condensed into one, the essential parts of each being combined
into a more complex character. This was much as if we were
to write “try” by forcing t and r into a special character showing
the cross stroke of the t and the roll or hook of the r, and
superposing a diæresis for the vowel. This process reduced
every syllable to a single though often compound letter. If the
syllable ended in a consonant, this carried over as the beginning
of the next syllable. Even the end consonant of a word
was written as the first letter of the next. According to the
Sanskrit plan, “the dog is mad” would be rendered “the do gi
sma d-.”</p>

<p>Obviously, there is something unnaturally regular, a systematic
artificiality, about such a scheme. Love of system cropped
out otherwise. The Hindus devised a new symbol—mainly by
differentiation of old ones—for every sound that they had and
Semitic lacked. Thus they doubled the number of their letters.
Then they rearranged their order on a phonetic and logical
basis. All sounds made against the back palate were brought
into one group; those formed against the fore-palate, gums, and
teeth came after; the lip sounds last. Within each of the groups<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
the letters followed one another in a fixed order according to
their method of production—voiceless stops always first, nasals
always last.</p>

<p>The result of these innovations was that the Hindu alphabets
diverged much more from the Semitic original than did ours.
This perhaps was really to be expected, since writing entered
India by long leaps between peoples that were not in intimate
relations. Also, by the time the alphabet first reached them, the
Hindus, in the isolation of their remote peninsula, had already
worked out an advanced and unique type of civilization. This
fact must have predisposed them to make over any imported
invention in conformity with their established habits.</p>

<h3 id="section148">148. <span class="smcap">The East Indies: Philippine Alphabets</span></h3>

<p>The spread of the Hindu alphabet within India, over southeastern
Asia, and into the East Indian archipelago, cannot be
followed here because it is an intricate story, interwoven with
the history of Brahmanism and Buddhism. It may be said that
in general, with the chief exception of China, Hindu writing
followed where Hindu religion penetrated. But it may be illuminating
to touch briefly on one of the extensions.</p>

<p>In the early centuries after Christ, Hindus began to reach
the East Indies, especially Sumatra and Java. Here they established
principalities or kingdoms and their religion. Many arts
were also imported by them, such as iron working, batik dyeing,
sculpture, drama, and writing. From perhaps the sixth to the
fifteenth centuries, the Malaysian population of Java lived under
a heavy layer of Hindu culture (§ <a href="#section104">104</a>, <a href="#section126">126</a>, <a href="#section262">262</a>), and literacy
evidently became fairly widespread. Greater or less portions
of this culture were transported to the other East Indian islands
and with them went writing. In the Philippines, the Spaniards
of the sixteenth century found several related alphabets, one to
each of the principal nationalities, which seem derived from
Bengal some eight hundred years before.</p>

<p>The Malayan languages are unusually simple in their array
of sounds. Hence the greater part of the elaborate Sanskrit
alphabet was discarded by them. But the salient characteristics
of Sanskrit writing were retained. A consonant was read as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
consonant plus A. Points were provided if the consonant was
to be read with other vowels. Of such points, the Philippine
alphabets employed only two. One, put above the consonant,
served indiscriminately for I and E, the other, below, for U
and O. The position of the points connects them with the Sanskrit
vowel signs. In this way the Philippine languages were
adequately rendered with a set of about twelve consonantal
letters, three for the independent vowels, and two vowel points.</p>

<p>At the time of the Spanish discovery, the native Philippine
alphabets were already meeting Arabic writing, which had
shortly before been introduced in the southern islands with
Mohammedanism. The Spaniards of course brought the Roman
alphabet. Under this double competition the use of native writing
soon began to decay. The most advanced of the Filipino
nationalities, such as the Tagalog and Bisaya, have long since
given up their old letters. Yet it has recently been discovered
that two varieties of the native writing still survive—both of
them among backward tribes: the Tagbanua of Palawan and
the Mangyan of Mindoro. Here in the jungle, among half
clothed savages living under rude thatches and without firearms
or government, the remotest descendants of the ancient Sanskrit
alphabet linger.</p>

<p>Three widely different descendants of the primitive Semitic
alphabet have therefore met in this archipelago. One, beginning
its journey some twenty-five hundred years ago, traveled
via Arabia and northern India, probably reaching the Philippines
by 800 A.D. The second evolved in the Semitic homeland,
finally poured out of northern Arabia with Mohammedanism,
was carried across India to the Malay Peninsula, and thence
leaped across the sea to Borneo and the Philippines about
1,400 A.D. The third followed the longest journey: from the
Phœnicians to the Greeks, to southern Italy, to Rome, to Spain,
and, after Columbus, to Mexico, and then across the Pacific
ocean to Manila shortly before A.D. 1,600.</p>

<h3 id="section149">149. <span class="smcap">Northern Asia: the Conflict of Systems in Korea</span></h3>

<p>The history of the central and north Asiatic alphabets is
complex. It may be summed up in the statement that Aramæan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
derivatives of the primitive Semitic writing, evolving in and
near Syria, in the six or seven centuries before the birth of
Christ, were carried east and northeast from one people to
another. One of the modifications of Aramæan, the Estrangelo
Syriac, was transported by a sect of heretical Christians, the
Nestorians, to the Uigurs and Mongols, from whom the Manchus
derived their system.</p>

<p>The farthest extension of the alphabet in Asia was to the
shores of the Pacific ocean, in Korea. Korean writing however
seems to be derived from an Indian source, through Tibetan or
perhaps Pali, the sacred language and script of the Southern
branch of Buddhism; hence to be only a remote collateral relative
of the neighboring Manchu. In Korea, the spread of the
alphabet was checked, not through any inherent flaws or weakness
of age, but by the competition of a totally different system
of writing: that of the Chinese.</p>

<p>Chinese writing is not alphabetic at all. To some extent it
does represent sounds. But it represents syllables or words,
not letters; and it represents them by the rebus method. The
basis of Chinese writing is ideographic. It is therefore a modified
form of picture writing, and theoretically pertains to an
early stage, almost comparable in principle to Egyptian hieroglyphs.</p>

<p>In a conflict between such a primitive system and a truly
alphabetic one, the latter should of course prevail on account
of its much greater efficiency and simplicity. Actually, however,
the Korean alphabet did not triumph but barely managed to
maintain an existence alongside Chinese. The cause was a
familiar one: the tremendous social conservatism of the human
mind.</p>

<p>When the native alphabet obtained its hold in Korea, it was
confronted by an overwhelming Chinese influence. The court,
the government, the institutions, official religion, all activities of
people of fashion and importance, were modeled after Chinese
examples. The man who could not write and read Chinese characters
was eliminated from polite society and advancement.
This was only natural. The civilization of China is one of the
most ancient and greatest in the world, and the Koreans were
a smaller people and close neighbors. Western civilization was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
thousands of miles away, and it was only now and then that a
driblet from it penetrated to the eastern edge of Asia. On one
side then stood the undoubted practical advantage of the
alphabet from the West; on the other, the momentum of the
whole mass of Chinese culture. The outcome was that the nationally
Korean and true alphabet became something that shopkeepers
and low people made use of; a thing easy to learn and
more or less contemptible. But laws and documents and books
of higher learning were written in Chinese characters, which
innumerable Koreans for generation after generation spent
years of their lives in mastering.</p>

<p>If the human mind were really rational, if it operated rationally
only a tenth as much as it fondly believes, it would not do
awkward and difficult things after a simpler and more effective
means to the same end had been put within its reach, as was the
case in this Korean situation. Another principle beyond mere
outright inertia is operative here. This is the tendency of culture
elements which have for some time been associated, often
only by accident, to form an interlocked aggregation or “complex.”
Once such a complex or cluster has acquired a certain
coherence, it survives with a tenacity independent of the degree
of inherent or logical connection between its elements. The fact
that ideographs were associated with Chinese religion, literature,
and institutions, constituted them part of what may be
called the Chinese complex. The mass of this Chinese complex
far overbalanced the slight and scattering Western influences.
The alphabet drifted into Korea as an isolated fragment, and
was promptly borne down by the weight of the elaborate and
closely knit culture aggregate of Chinese origin. This brute
fact, and not any superior reasonableness or intrinsic merit of
one system or the other, determined the issue between them.</p>

<p>In the same way the “complex” that we know as Western
civilization—Christianity and collars, science and picture films,
factory labor and democracy, fine and base all tangled together—is
to-day crushing the breath out of ancient and exotic cultures.
We like to call the process “Progress” because that is
more comforting than to view it as the rolling of a fate beyond
our control.</p>

<h3 id="section150">150. <span class="smcap">Regional Variation of Culture</span></h3>

<p>As one first becomes acquainted with a totally strange people
spread over a large area, such as the Indians of North America,
they are likely to seem rather uniform. The distinctions between
individual and individual, and even the greater distinctions
between one group and another, become buried under the overwhelming
mass-effect of their difference from ourselves. Growing
familiarity, however, renders individual, local, and tribal
peculiarities plainer. The specialist, finally, comes to concern
himself with particular traits until the peculiarities occupy more
of his attention than the uniformities. His danger always is to
let himself get into the habit of taking sweeping similarities so
much for granted that he ends by underemphasizing or forgetting
them. At the same time his business is to add something
new to human understanding—facts at any rate, interpretation
if possible. Generalities are likely to be pretty widely known,
and progress, new formulations, therefore depend ultimately on
mastery of detail. This means that if a scientist is to contribute
anything to the world’s comprehension, is to add a new mental
tool to its chest, he must devote himself to specific traits, to discriminations
of fine detail. It is only by finding new trees that
he helps to make the woods larger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>If then we approach a race like the American Indians with
the scientist’s or student’s purpose of discovering something
more than we already know, we quickly find that institutions,
customs, and utensils, in other words the cultures, vary from
tribe to tribe. When one compares tribes living so far apart as
to be no longer united in intercourse, nor even by communication
with common intermediaries, there is scarcely a trait in
which their cultures are wholly identical. Within a limited district
a fair degree of uniformity is found to prevail. Yet when
the boundaries of such an area are crossed, a new type of culture
begins to be encountered, which again holds with local
variations until a third district is entered.</p>

<h3 id="section151">151. <span class="smcap">Plains, Southwest, Northwest Areas</span></h3>

<p>For instance, the Indians of the Plains between the Rocky
mountains and the Mississippi river form a comparative unit.
They are all warlike, the great aim in life of every man in these
tribes being attainment of military glory. All the Plains tribes
subsisted to a large extent on buffalo, lived in tipis—tents
made of buffalo skins—and boiled their food with hot stones in
buffalo rawhide. Nearly all of them performed a four days’
religious ceremony known as the Sun Dance, of which one of the
outstanding acts was fasting and sometimes self-torture inflicted
with skewers drawn through the skin and torn out. These customs
were common to the Sioux, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Crow,
Blackfeet, Assiniboine, Omaha, Kiowa, Comanche, and other
tribes.</p>

<p>As one passes from this region to the mountainous plateau
which constitutes the present New Mexico and Arizona—the
Southwest of the United States—one encounters a series of
tribes often inhabiting stone houses, subsisting by agriculture,
cooking in earthenware pots, little given to fighting, according
authority to priests rather than warriors, erecting altars, and
performing masked dances representing divinities. This Southwestern
culture, its internal relations, and the tribes participating
in it, have already been discussed in another connection
(§ <a href="#section87">87</a>).</p>

<p>If, however, on leaving the Plains one turns northwest to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
shores of British Columbia and southern Alaska, a third distinctive
type of native civilization appears. Among these Northwestern
or North Pacific Coast tribes, such as the Tlingit, Haida,
Tsimshian, Kwakiutl, Nutka, and Salish, the priest as well as
the warrior bowed before the rich man, an elaborate set of rules
and honors separating the wealthy high-born from the poor and
lowly. Aristocracy, commoners, and slaves made up distinct
strata of society in this region. Public rituals were occasions
for the ostentation of wealth. Houses were carpentered of wood.
Cooking was done in boxes. The prevalent food was fish.</p>

<p>The significant thing is that these are not three tribes, but
three groups each consisting of a number of politically independent
tribes spread over a considerable territory and evincing
a fairly fundamental similarity of customs and institutions. We
are confronting three kinds of culture, each super-tribal in
range and attached to a certain area. These areas have sometimes
been called “ethnographic provinces”; they are generally
known as “culture-areas.” Of such areas ten are generally
recognized on the North American continent. These are the
Plains, Southwest, North Pacific Coast, Mackenzie-Yukon, Arctic,
Plateau, California, Northeast, Southeast, and Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Obviously we have here a classification comparable to that
which the naturalist makes of animals. As the zoölogist divides
the vertebrate animals into mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians,
and fishes, so the anthropologist divides the generic North
American Indian culture into the cultures of these ten areas.
The naturalist however cannot stop with a group as inclusive as
the mammals, and goes on to subdivide them into orders, such
as the rodents, carnivores, ungulates, and the like. Each of
these again he goes on splitting into families, genera, and finally
species. The species correspond to the smallest groups in human
society, namely the tribes or nations. Parallel to the family or
order which the naturalist finds between a particular species and
the great class of mammals, one may therefore expect to discover
groups intermediate between particular tribes and the
large culture-areas. Such intermediate groups would consist of
clusters of tribes constituting fractions of a culture-area: clearly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
pertaining to this area, but yet somewhat set off from other
clusters within the same area—like the Pueblos and Navaho
within the Southwest, as already described (§ <a href="#section87">87</a>). We may
call such clusters or fractions sub-culture-areas, and must concern
ourselves with them if we desire to deepen our understanding
of aboriginal American civilization.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity, it will be well to select a limited
portion of North America, instead of wrestling with the intricacies
of the continent as a whole, in an endeavor to see how its
culture-areas and sub-culture-areas reveal themselves in detail
and help to throw light on native history. California will serve
as a type example.</p>

<h3 id="section152">152. <span class="smcap">California and Its Sub-areas</span></h3>

<p>Modern state boundaries frequently do not coincide with
either ethnic lines of division or with natural physiographic
areas, especially when political units are created by legislative
enactment, as has been the case with most of the United States.
This partial discrepancy holds for California. The native culture
most distinctive of California covered only the middle two-thirds
of the present state, but took in Nevada and much of the
Great Basin (<a href="#figure31">Fig. 31</a>).</p>

<p>Northernmost California, especially along the ocean, was inhabited
by Indians that affiliated with the tribes of the North
Pacific coast. One after another their customs and arts prove
on examination to be related to the customs and arts of the coast
of British Columbia, and to differ more or less from the corresponding
practices of the Central California Indians. Here
then we have a second cultural type, that of Northwestern California,
which constitutes a subdivision of the North Pacific
Coast culture-area.</p>

<p>The southern California Indians link with the Indians of
the adjoining states of Arizona and New Mexico. In short, this
part of California forms part of the Southwest culture-area.
The southern California tribes are however not wholly uniform
among themselves, but constitute two groups: those of the
islands, coast, and mountains, and those of the Colorado river.
These are distinguished primarily by the fact that only the river
tribes practised agriculture. We may designate these two divisions
as “Southern California” proper and “Lower Colorado
River.”</p>

<p>The table on the opposite page gives a brief characterization
of these four sub-culture-areas.</p>

<h3 id="section153">153. <span class="smcap">The Shaping of a Problem</span></h3>

<p>So far we have been discriminating, that is, looking for
characteristic differences. On the other hand, there has always
existed a consensus of impression, among experienced as well as
hasty observers, that a certain likeness runs through the culture
of most the tribes of California, northern, central, and southern.
With scarcely an exception they were unwarlike; nearly all of
them made excellent baskets, but were deficient in wood-working.
Obviously it is necessary to reconcile these uniformities with the
peculiarities that distinguish the four regional types or sub-culture-areas,
as well as to account for the peculiarities.</p>

<p>Let us simplify the problem by considering only one aspect
of the four native cultures instead of the whole cultures. In
this way there will be more likelihood of making a substantial
beginning; any results obtained from the example can be subsequently
checked from other aspects of the cultures to see if
the findings are broadly representative. Further, let us arrange
the items of information that are available on this one aspect
of culture, not haphazardly, nor mechanically as under an
alphabetic classification, nor in the sequence in which authors
have published their observations, but naturally, or according
to some principle that is likely to work out into an interpretation.
Since part of the problem is the relation of the uniform
features to the peculiar ones, a promising order will be to put
at one end of the line or series of data the most universal features,
and at the other the most particular or localized ones.</p>

<p>Let us select religion as that part of native culture to be
examined, and limit this still farther by eliminating from consideration,
for the time being, all forms of religion except public
rituals, which among Indians are frequently accompanied or
signalized by sacred dances. We may forget, for the moment,
private rites, individual sacrifices, superstitions and taboos,
medicine men, myths, and the like, and direct attention to
dances made by groups of people, or the obvious equivalents of
such dances, and ritual acts definitely associated with the dances
or the common weal.</p>

<p>Choice of this phase of native culture is not quite random;
ritual ordinarily is rather freer from the complications caused
by natural environment than most other institutions and customs.
Had industrial arts, for instance, been selected as the
point of attack, it might be imagined that certain tribes made
pottery, and others did not, because of the presence or absence
of suitable clay in their respective habitats; or perhaps that a
particular weave of basketry occurred universally because this
weave followed more or less directly from the physical properties
of some plant material that abounded everywhere in the
state. On the other hand, when tribes do or do not make dances
in honor of their divinities, or when they do or do not practise
an elaborate mourning for their dead, these are customs into
which the influence of natural environment can scarcely enter,
since all peoples believe in spirits and suffer the loss of relatives.</p>

<h3 id="section154">154. <span class="smcap">Girls’ Adolescence Rite</span></h3>

<p>When, then, we review the religious dances of the California
tribes en masse, we find that there are only two which come near
to being universal. One of these is the Victory Dance held over
the head or scalp of a slain enemy; the other is an Adolescence
Rite performed for girls at puberty. The latter is the more
profitable to consider. It is the more widely spread, having been
performed in every district of California, and by almost every
tribe. The Victory Dance was not made by the Indians of
northern California, who substituted for it a war incitement
dance of different character. Further, a tribe having the tradition
of the Victory Dance might often be at peace and go for
a generation or two without the celebration. But a ceremony
which it was thought necessary to make for each girl at puberty
was obviously due to be performed every few years even among
a small group.</p>

<p>There are many local variations in the Californian Adolescence
Rite, but certain of its features emerge with constancy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
These traits are based on the belief that the girl who is at this
moment passing from childhood to maturity must be undergoing
a critical transition. The occasion was considered critical not
only for her but for the community, and, since the Indians’
outlook was limited, for the whole of their little world. A girl
who at this period did not show fortitude to hardship would
be forever weak and complaining: therefore she fasted. If she
carried wood and water industriously, she would remain a good
worker all her life, whereas if she defaulted, she would grow
up a lazy woman. So crucial, in fact, was this moment, that
she was thought extremely potent upon her surroundings, as
constituting a latent danger. If she looked abroad upon the
world, oak trees might become barren and next year’s crop of
acorns fail, or the salmon refuse to ascend the river. Among
many tribes, therefore, the maturing girl was covered with a
blanket, set under a large basket, or made to wear a visor of
feathers over her eyes. Others had her throw her hair forward
and keep her head bowed. She was given the benefit of having
ancient religious songs sung over her, and dances revolved
around her night after night. Certain additional developments
of the ceremony were locally restricted. Thus it was only in the
south that the girl was put into a pit and baked in hot sand.
But a number of specific features occur from the north to the
south end of the state. Among these are the following rules.
The girl must not eat meat, fat, or salt. She must not scratch
her head with her fingers, but use a stick or bone implement
made for the purpose. She must not look at people; and she
should be sung over.</p>

<p>It should be added that most of these traits of the Girls’ Rite
recur among the tribes of a much larger area than California,
including those of Nevada and the Great Basin and the Pacific
coast for a long distance north. This institution, then, is remarkably
widespread and has preserved nearly the same fundamental
features wherever it is found.</p>

<h3 id="section155">155. <span class="smcap">The First Period</span></h3>

<p>What can be inferred from this uniformity and broad diffusion?
It seems fair to try the presumptive conclusion of antiquity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
A continent is likely to be older than an island. A
family of animals has probably existed longer than a single
species. A world-wide custom normally is more ancient than
one that is confined to a narrow locality. If it spread from one
people to another, this diffusion over the whole earth would
usually require a long time. If on the other hand such a custom
had originated separately among each people, its very universality
would indicate it as the response to a deep and primary
need, and such a need would presumably manifest itself early
in the history of the race.</p>

<p>It is true that one may not place too positive a reliance on
evidence of this sort. The history of civilization furnishes some
contrary examples. Thus the Persian fire-worshiping religion
is older than Christianity, yet is now confined to the Parsees of
Bombay and to one or two small groups in Persia. The use of
tobacco has spread over the eastern hemisphere in four centuries.
Still, such cases are exceptional; and in the absence of
specific contrary considerations, heavy weight must be given to
wideness of occurrence in rating antiquity.</p>

<p>If the Girls’ Rite were identical among all the tribes that
practise it, there might be warrant for the conclusion that it had
originated only a few centuries ago but had for some reason been
carried from one tribe to another with such unusual rapidity as
not to have been subjected to the alterations of time. Yet the
fact that the essential uniformity of the rite is overlaid by so
much local diversity—as for instance the baking custom restricted
to southern California—indicates the unlikelihood of
such a rapid and late diffusion. The ceremony is much in the
status of Christianity, which, in the course of its long history,
has also become broken into national varieties or sects, all of
which however remain Christian.</p>

<p>The facts then warrant this tentative conclusion: that the
Girls’ Rite is representative of the oldest stratum of religion
that can be traced among the Indians of California—their
“First Period.” The Victory Dance would presumably be of
nearly but not quite the same antiquity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<h3 id="section156">156. <span class="smcap">The Second Period: Mourning Anniversary and First-salmon Rite</span></h3>

<p>Pursuing the same method farther, let us look for rituals that
are less widely spread than these but yet not confined to small
districts. The outstanding one in this class is the Mourning
Anniversary. This is a custom of bewailing each year, or at
intervals of a few years, those members of the tribe who have
died since the last performance, and the burning of large quantities
of wealth—shell money, baskets, and the like—in their
memory. Each family offers for its own dead, but people of
special consideration are honored by having images made of
them and consumed with the property. Until the anniversary
has been performed, the relatives of the dead remain mourners.
After it, they are free to resume normal enjoyment of life; and
the name of the deceased, which until then has been strictly
taboo, may now be bestowed on a baby in the family.</p>

<p>The Mourning Anniversary as here outlined is practised with
little variation, less than the Girls’ Rite shows, throughout
southern California and a great part of central California, especially
the Sierra Nevada district. Its distribution thus covers
more than half of the state. But it has not spread elsewhere
except to a small area in southern Nevada and western Arizona.</p>

<p>In northern California the Mourning Anniversary is lacking.
It is not that the Indians here fail to mourn their dead. In
fact they frequently bewail them for a longer time than most
civilized peoples think necessary. They may bury or burn some
property with the corpse. But they do not practise the regular
public commemoration of the southerly tribes. They do not
assiduously accumulate wealth for months or years in order to
throw it into a communal fire at the end. And they do not
make images of their dead. In fact, they would be shocked at
the idea as indelicate, if not impious. Is there anything in this
northern part of California that takes the place of the anniversary?</p>

<p>Not as a psychological equivalent; but as regards distribution,
there is. This is the custom, established in northern California
and parts of Oregon, for a leading shaman or medicine-man to
conduct a ceremony at the beginning of each year’s salmon run.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
Until he had done this, no one fished for salmon or ate them.
If any got caught, they were carefully returned to the river.
When the medicine-man had gone through his secret rites, he
caught and ate the first fish of the year. After this, the season
was open. To eat salmon no longer brought illness and disaster,
as it was thought it would a few days earlier. Moreover, the
prayers or formulas recited by the shaman propitiated the
salmon and caused them to run abundantly, so that every one
had plenty. There is clearly a communal motive in the rite,
even though its performance was entrusted to an individual.</p>

<p>The one specific element common to the Mourning Anniversary
and this First-salmon Rite is their connection with the
natural year, the cycle of the seasons, a trait necessarily lacking
in the Girls’ Rite with its intimately personal character.
Because of this common feature; because, also, neither of these
two rituals is as widespread as the Girls’ Rite and yet between
them they cover the whole of California with substantially
mutual exclusiveness, it seems fair to assume that they both
originated at a later time than the Girls’ Rite, but still in fairly
remote antiquity. They may therefore be provisionally assigned
to a Second Period of the prehistory of California.</p>

<h3 id="section157">157. <span class="smcap">Era of Regional Differentiation</span></h3>

<p>It is now necessary to return to the four regional divisions or
sub-culture-areas of the modern tribes of California. Since the
Northwestern one affiliated with the extensive North Pacific
culture, and those of Southern California and the Colorado
River with the great culture of the Southwest, many of their
customs must have originated in those parts of these two culture-areas
which lie outside of California. Even if the northern and
southern Californians “lent” as well as “borrowed” inventions
and institutions, they must on the whole have received or learned
or imitated more in the interchange than they imparted. This
is clear from the fact that the Indians of British Columbia are
more advanced in their manufacturing ability, richer in variety
of tools and utensils, and more elaborate in their organization
of society, than those of Northwestern California; and a similar
relation of superiority and priority exists between the Pueblos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
of New Mexico and Arizona and the Southern California tribes
(§ <a href="#section87">87</a>). In other words, a stream of civilizational influences has
evidently run from southern Alaska and British Columbia
southward along the coast as far as Northwestern California,
and another from the town-dwelling Pueblos to the village-inhabiting
tribes of Southern California, in much the same way
that civilization flowed from ancient Babylonia into Palestine,
from Egypt into Crete, from Greece to Rome, from Rome to
Gaul and Britain, from western Europe to the Americas after
their discovery, and from the Christian to the non-Christian
nations of to-day. Somewhere in the unraveling of the prehistory
of California the first indications of these streams from
the outside should be encountered.</p>

<p>They are not manifest in the two periods which have so far
been established. The distribution of the Girls’ Rite of the
First Period and of the Mourning Anniversary and First-salmon
Rite of the Second, does not coincide with the major culture-areas
of the continent. The Southwest, for instance, from which
the modern southern Californians have received so much, does
not possess any of these ceremonies. The Southwest culture
therefore evidently originated, or began to take on its recent
aspect, or at least to influence Southern California, chiefly after
the two periods had passed by in which these ceremonies became
established in California. The Girls’ Rite, to be sure, extends
up the Pacific coast into Alaska. Yet it is more widespread
than the North Pacific Coast culture, since this has its southerly
limit in Northwestern California, whereas the ceremony is universal
as far as to the southern end of the state, besides occurring
inland throughout the Great Basin and Plateau regions.
Being more widely spread than the Coast culture, the Girls’ Rite
is presumptively more ancient.</p>

<p>The beginnings of the four modern types of California native
culture must thus evidently be looked for at about the point
now reached in our reconstruction. At first there was a single
very widespread ceremony; then two less widely diffused ones;
the next logical step in development would have been the growth
of a still larger number of ceremonies or ritual systems. These,
on account of their greater recency, and perhaps on account of
conflicting with one another, would have spread only over comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
small areas. Let us therefore assume that to this
Third Period belonged the beginnings of the Wealth-display
dances of the Northwestern Indians which are coupled with the
idea of world renovation (table, p. 299); the so-called Kuksu
dances made among the Central Californians by members of
a secret society disguised as divinities; the Jimsonweed rites
of the Southern tribes who use this narcotic plant as a mystical
means of initiating the young into their religious society; and
the series of long singings that the Colorado River tribes are
addicted to and believe they have miraculously dreamed.</p>

<p>Of course, the idea could scarcely be entertained that these
four local systems sprang into existence full-fledged. They are
complicated sets of rituals, quite different from the simple Girls’
Rite and Mourning Anniversary. They must have grown up
gradually from more meager beginnings and have been a considerable
time reaching their present elaboration. It would
thus seem justifiable to add not only one but two further periods
of religious growth, in the earlier of which—the Third—these
ceremonial systems of the historic Indians began their development,
whereas in the later or Fourth they achieved it.</p>

<h3 id="section158">158. <span class="smcap">Third and Fourth Periods in Central California: Kuksu and Hesi</span></h3>

<p>For instance, in the Central California sub-culture-area a
series of tribes possess a society to which young men are admitted
only after a double initiation with formal teaching by
their elders, the first initiation coming in boyhood, the second
soon after puberty. The society holds great four-day dances
in large earth-covered houses. Time is beaten to the dance and
song with rattles of split sticks, and stamped with the feet on a
great log drum. The dancers wear showy feather costumes
which disguise them to the uninitiated women, children, and
strangers, who take them to be spirits of old that have come
to exhibit themselves for the good of the people. There may be
as many as twelve divinities represented in this way, each with
his distinctive name and dress. One of the most prominent of
these is the god or “first-man” Kuksu, the founder of the sacred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
rites, after whom the entire system has been named the “Kuksu
Cult.”</p>

<p>The tribes participating in the Kuksu Cult are the Patwin,
nearer Maidu, Porno, Yuki, Miwok, and several others. They
occupy an area which may be described as the heart of California:
namely, the districts adjoining the lower Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers and the Bay of San Francisco into
which the two streams pour the drainage of the great interior
valley (<a href="#figure32">Fig. 32</a>).</p>

<p>Beyond the Kuksu-dancing tribes there are others, like the
farther Maidu, the Wailaki, and some of the Yokuts, among
whom the medicine-men are wont to gather for public demonstration
of their magical prowess. Thus, they assemble for a
competition of “throwing” sickness into one another, or to
charm the rattlesnakes so that they can be handled and that
no one in the tribe may be bitten during the ensuing year. In
these gatherings there is the idea of an association of people
endowed with particular powers and operating more or less
jointly for the benefit of the community. In short, this fringe
of Central tribes beyond the border of the Kuksu Cult evince
some of the psychology and motives of the Cult, but without
the definite organization of the latter, and also without some of
its specific practices, such as god-impersonation. These gatherings
of the medicine men thus look as if they might have been
the simple and generalized substratum out of which the Kuksu
Cult grew by a process of gradual formalization and ritualistic
elaboration. This conclusion is corroborated by the distribution.
It is the tribes at the ends of the great interior valley, or in
the hills above it, whose rites are of this loose type, while in
the center are the true Kuksu-dancing groups. There is a
periphery of low organization and a core of high organization.
According to our previous rule (§ <a href="#section87">87</a>, <a href="#section97">97</a>), recency in acquisition
but antiquity of stage pertain to the marginal as the more
widely distributed; the geographically more compact nucleus
representing an earlier beginning but a later stage of present
development. That is, it is reasonable to believe that the Kuksu
Cult grew out of semi-formal gatherings of medicine-men such
as still survive in the outlying districts—the “backwoods” of
the Central area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>Evidently if a still later religious movement developed as an
elaboration or addition of the Kuksu Cult, it should be less
widely diffused than this system, forming a sort of nucleus
within the core. Actually there is such a later growth. This
is the Hesi Dance, confined to the Patwin and Maidu of the
lower Sacramento valley (<a href="#figure32">Fig. 32</a>), and regarded by them as
the most sacred portion of the Kuksu system. It is the one of
all their rituals into which the largest number of differently
garbed performers enter, and is made twice a year as the spectacular
beginning and finale of the series of lesser Kuksu dances.</p>

<p>The history of native ritual in Central California thus is
fairly plain. Early in the Third Period, perhaps already during
the Second, the specialists in religion, the medicine-men, had
acquired the habit of giving public demonstrations. This resulted
in a bond of fellowship among themselves and a sense
of exclusiveness toward the community as a whole. Out of this
sense there was elaborated during the Third Period, somewhere
about the lower Sacramento Valley, the idea of an organized
secret society with initiated members. The performances became
more and more elaborate, and the production of proof of
supernatural power gradually crystallized into impersonations
of deities. By the beginning of the Fourth Period, the Kuksu
Cult had been established. During this period, it was carried
from the center of origin to its farthest limits, whereas at the
center the Hesi Dance was evolved as a characteristic addition.
If native development had been able to proceed undisturbed, if,
for instance, the coming of the white race had been deferred a
few centuries longer, the Hesi might have followed the diffusion
of the earlier Kuksu Cult; and while this new spread was in
progress, the Patwin who form the central nucleus of the whole
Kuksu-Hesi movement might have been devising a still newer
increment to the system.</p>

<h3 id="section159">159. <span class="smcap">Third and Fourth Periods in Southern California: Jimsonweed and Chungichnish</span></h3>

<p>The Southern California Jimsonweed Rites are quite distinct
from the Kuksu Cult in their regalia, dances, and teachings, but
are also based on initiation. It may therefore be concluded,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
first, that they grew up contemporaneously in the Third Period;
and next, that they sprang out of the same soil, a growing tendency
of the medicine-men toward professional association. The
selection of the jimsonweed as the distinctive element in the
south seems to have been due to influences from Mexico and
the Southwest. The tribes of Arizona and New Mexico use the
plant in religion, the Aztecs ascribed supernatural powers to it,
and the modern Tepecano of Mexico pray to it like a god. The
Spanish-American name for the plant, toloache, is an Aztec
word. Because Mexican civilization was so much the more advanced,
it seems likely that the use of jimsonweed originated in
Mexico, was carried into the Southwest, and from there spread
into Southern California—perhaps at the receptive moment
when the medicine-men’s associations were drawing more closely
together and feeling the need of some powerful emotional element
to lend an impetus to their cults.</p>

<p>While the Jimsonweed religion was followed by Californian
tribes from the Yokuts on the north to the Diegueño on the
south, its most elaborate forms occur among groups near the
center of Southern California, especially the Gabrielino of Los
Angeles and Catalina Island. This group associates the greatest
number of rituals and dances with the Jimsonweed Society, and
is therefore likely to have had the leading share in the working
out of the religion.</p>

<p>By the opening of the Fourth Period the Gabrielino must
have had the Jimsonweed Rites pretty fully developed, while
the peripheral tribes like the Yokuts and Diegueño were perhaps
only learning the religious use of the drug. The Gabrielino
however did not stand still during this Fourth Period,
and while the original rather simple Jimsonweed Rites spread
north and south, they were adding a new element. This is the
Chungichnish Cult, based on belief in a great, wise, powerful
god of this name, to whom are due the final ordaining of the
world and the institution of the Jimsonweed Rites and their
correct performance. Associated with this belief is the use of
the “ground painting.” This is a large picture, usually of the
world, drawn in colored earths, sands, seeds, or paints, on the
floor of the sacred enclosure in which the Jimsonweed rituals
were practised. This ground painting served both as an altar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
for the rites and as a means of instructing the initiates (§ <a href="#section192">192</a>,
<a href="#section193">193</a>). The custom of this sacred painting became firmly established
among the Gabrielino, and is known to have spread from
them to other tribes, such as the Luiseño. From these it has
been carried, in part during the last century, after the white
man was in the land, to still more remote tribes like the Diegueño,
who recognize the Gabrielino island of Catalina as the source
of the Chungichnish Cult and sing its songs to Gabrielino
words (<a href="#figure32">Fig. 32</a>).</p>

<h3 id="section160">160. <span class="smcap">Third and Fourth Periods on the Lower Colorado: Dream Singing</span></h3>

<p>In Southeastern California, among the tribes of the Lower
Colorado River, the Third and Fourth Periods are less easily
distinguished. The reason for this seems to be the fact that
religion developed among these tribes less through the invention
or establishment of new elements, than by the lopping away of
older ones, with the result of a rather narrow specialization on
the few elements that were retained. Tribes like the Yuma and
Mohave scarcely danced for religious purposes. The special
costumes, showy feather headdresses, disguises, musical instruments,
sand-paintings, altars, and ritualistic processions that
mark the Kuksu and Jimsonweed cults, were lacking among
them. They did adhere to the widespread and ancient idea
that dreams are a source and evidence of supernatural power.
In short, their religion turned inward, not outward. Instead of
their medicine-men forming a society based on initiation, the
Colorado River tribes came to feel that every one might be a
medicine-man according to his dreams. They put emphasis on
these internal experiences. The result has been that they believe
that a legend can be true and sacred only if it has been
dreamed, and that a man’s songs should be acquired in the same
way. Religion, therefore, is an intensely individualistic affair
among them. Since no two men can dream quite alike, no two
Yumas or Mohaves tell their myths or sing their song cycles
identically. This cast to their religion is so strong that it looks
to be fairly ancient. The beginnings of this local type of religion
may therefore be set in the Third Period. As for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
Fourth Period, it may be inferred that this chiefly accentuated
the tendencies developed in the Third, the dream basis augmenting
as ceremonialism dropped away.</p>

<h3 id="section161">161. <span class="smcap">Northwestern California: World-renewal and Wealth Display</span></h3>

<p>The Third and Fourth periods are also not readily distinguishable
in Northwestern California. Yet here the rooting of
these two eras in the Second is clearer. We have seen that all
through northern California there exists the First-salmon Rite
conducted by a prominent medicine-man of each locality; and
we have referred the probable origin of this rite to the Second
period. The modern Indians of Northwestern California consider
their great dances of ten or twelve days’ duration as being
essentially the showy public accompaniment of an extremely
sacred and secret act performed by a single priest who recites
a magical formula. His purpose in some instances is to open
the salmon season, in others to inaugurate the acorn crop, in still
others to make new fire for the community. But whatever the
particular object, it is always believed that he renews something
important to the world. He “makes the world,” as the Indians
call it, for another year. These New-year or World-renewing
functions of the rites of the modern Indians of Northwestern
California thus appear to lead back by a natural transition to
the First-salmon Rite which is so widely spread in northern
California. Evidently this specific rite that originated in the
Second Period was developed in the Northwest during the Third
and Fourth eras by being broadened in its objective and having
attached to it certain characteristic dances.</p>

<p>These dances are the Deerskin and Jumping Dances. They
differ from those of the Central and Southern tribes in that
every one may participate in them. There is no idea of a society
with membership, and hence no exclusion of the uninitiated.
In fact the dances are primarily occasions for displays of
wealth, which are regarded as successful in proportion to the
size of the audience. The albino deerskins, ornaments of woodpecker
scalps, furs, and great blades of flint and obsidian which
are carried in these dances, constitute the treasures of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
tribes. The dances are the best opportunity of the rich men to
produce their heirlooms before the public and in that way signalize
the honor of ownership—which is one of the things dearest
in life to the Northwest Californian.</p>

<p>Another feature of these Northwestern dances which marks
them off from the Central and Southern ones is the fact that
they can only be held in certain spots. A Kuksu dance is rightly
made indoors, but any properly built dance house will answer
for its performance. A Yurok or Hupa however would consider
it fundamentally wrong to make a Deerskin Dance other
than on the accepted spot where his great-grandfather had
always seen it. The reason for this attachment to the spot seems
to be his conviction that the most essential part of the dance
is a secret, magical rite enacted only in the specified place because
the formula recited as its nucleus mentions that spot.</p>

<p>In the Northwest we again seem to be able to recognize, as
in the Central and Southern regions, an increasing contraction
of area for each successively developed ritual. Whereas the
First-salmon Rite of the Second Period covers the whole northern
third of California and parts of Oregon, the Wealth-display
dances and World-renewing rites of the Third and Fourth Periods
occur only in Northwestern California. The Jumping
Dance was performed at a dozen or more villages, the slightly
more splendid Deerskin Dance only in eight (<a href="#figure32">Fig. 32</a>). This
suggests that the Jumping Dance is the earlier, possibly going
back to the Third Period, whereas the Deerskin Dance more
probably originated during the Fourth.</p>

<h3 id="section162">162. <span class="smcap">Summary of Religious Development</span></h3>

<p>The history of religious cults among the Indians of California
seems thus to be reconstructible, with some probability of correctness
in its essential outlines, as a progressive differentiation
during four fairly distinct periods. During these four eras,
the most typical cults gradually changed from a personal to a
communal aim, ceremonies grew more numerous as well as more
elaborate, influences from the outside affected the tribes within
California, and local differences increased until the original
rather close uniformity had been replaced by four quite distinct
systems of cults, separated in most cases by transitional
areas in which the less specialized developments of the earlier
stages have been preserved. This history may be expressed in
visual form, as on <a href="#table1">page 314</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section163">163. <span class="smcap">Other Phases of Culture</span></h3>

<p>A natural question arises here. Does this reconstructed history
apply only to ritual cults, or can a parallel development
be traced for other elements of religion, for industries, inventions,
and economic relations, for social institutions, for knowledge
and art? The findings are that this history holds for all
phases of native culture. Material and social development progressed
much as did religion. Each succeeding stage brought in
new implements and customs, these became on the whole more
specialized as well as more numerous, and differed more and
more locally in the four sub-culture-areas. Thus the plain or
self bow belongs demonstrably to an earlier stratum than the
sinew-backed one, basketry precedes pottery, twined basketry is
earlier than coiled, the stone mortar antedates the slab with
basketry mortar as the oval metate does the squared one, earth-covered
sweat houses are older than plank roofed ones, and
totemism may have become established before the division of
society into exogamic moieties. It would be a long story to
adduce the evidence for each of these determinations and all
others that could be made. It will perhaps suffice to say that
the principles by which they are arrived at are the same as
those which have guided us in the inquiry into religion. It may
therefore be enough to indicate results in a scheme, as on
<a href="#table2">page 315</a>. It will be seen that this is nothing but an amplification
of the preceding table. The framework there constructed
to represent the history of native rituals has here been further
filled with elements of material and social culture.</p>

<h3 id="section164">164. <span class="smcap">Outline of the Culture History of California</span></h3>

<p>In general terms, the net results of our inquiry can be stated
thus.</p>

<p>First Period: a simple, meager culture, nearly uniform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
throughout California, similar to the cultures of adjacent regions,
and only slightly influenced by these.</p>

<p>Second Period: definite influences from the North Pacific
Coast and the Southwest, affecting respectively the northern
third and the southern two thirds of California, and thus leading
to a first differentiation of consequence.</p>

<p>Third Period: more specific influences from outside, resulting
in the formation of four local types: the Northwestern, under
North Pacific influences; the Southern and Lower Colorado
under stimulus of the Southwest; and the Central, farthest
remote from both and thus developing most slowly but also
most independently.</p>

<p>Fourth Period: consummation of the four local types. Influences
from outside continue operative, but in the main the lines
of local development entered upon in the previous era are followed
out, reaching their highest specialization in limited tracts
central to each area.</p>

<p>This summary not only outlines the course of culture history
in native California: it also explains why there are both widely
uniform and narrowly localized culture elements in the region.
It thus answers the question why from one aspect the tribes of
the state seem so much alike and from another angle they appear
endlessly different. They are alike largely insofar as they have
retained certain old common traits. They are different to the
degree that they have severally added traits of later and localized
development.</p>

<h3 id="section165">165. <span class="smcap">The Question of Dating</span></h3>

<p>A natural question is how long these periods lasted. As regards
accurate dating, there is only one possible answer: we
do not know nearly enough. Moreover modern historians, who
possess infinitely fuller records on chronology than anthropologists
can ever hope to have on primitive peoples, tend more and
more to lay little weight on specific dates. They may set 476
A.D., the so-called fall of Rome, as the point of demarcation
between ancient and mediæval history because it is sometimes
useful, especially in elementary presentation, to speak definitely.
But no historian believes that any profound change took place<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
between 475 and 477 A.D. That is an impression beginners may
get from the way history is sometimes taught. Yet it is well
recognized that certain slow, progressive changes were going on
uninterruptedly for centuries before and after; and that if the
date 476 A.D. is arbitrarily inserted into the middle of this
development, it is because to do so is conventionally convenient,
and with full understanding that the event marked was dramatic
or symbolic rather than intrinsically significant. In fact, the
value of a historian’s work lies precisely in his ability to show
that the forces which shaped mediæval history were already at
work during the period of ancient times and that the causes
which had molded the Roman empire continued to operate in
some degree for many centuries after the fall of Rome.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there is no doubt that occasional dates have the
virtue of impressing the mind with the vividness which specific
statements alone possess. Also, if the results of anthropological
studies are to be connected with the written records of history
proper, at least tentative dates must be formulated, though of
course in a case like this of the periods of native culture in
California it is understood that all chronology is subject to a
wide margin of error.</p>

<p>History provides a start toward a computation, although its
aid is a short one. California began to be settled about 1770.
The last tribes were not brought into contact with the white
man until 1850. As early, however, as 1540 Alarcón rowed and
towed up the lower Colorado and wrote an account of the tribes
he encountered there. Two years later, Cabrillo visited the coast
and island tribes of southern California, and wintered among
them. In 1579 Drake spent some weeks on shore among the
central Californians and a member of his crew has left a brief
but spirited description of them. In all three instances these
old accounts of native customs tally with remarkable fidelity with
all that has been ascertained in regard to the recent tribes of
the same regions. That is, native culture has evidently changed
very little since the sixteenth century. The local sub-cultures
already showed substantially their present form; which means
that the Fourth Period must have been well established three
to four centuries ago. We might then assign to this period
about double the time which has elapsed since the explorers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
visited California; say seven hundred years. This seems a conservative
figure, which would put the commencement of the
Fourth Period somewhere about 1200 A.D.</p>

<p>All the remainder must be reconstruction by projection. In
most parts of the world for which there are continuous records,
it is found that civilization usually changes more rapidly as
time goes on. While this is not a rigorous law, it is a prevailing
tendency. However, let us apply this principle with reserve,
and assume that the Third Period was no longer than the
Fourth. Another seven hundred years would carry back to
500 A.D.</p>

<p>Now, however, it seems reasonable to begin to lengthen our
periods somewhat. For the Second, a thousand years does not
appear excessive: approximately from 500 B.C. to 500 A.D. By
the same logic the First Period should be allowed from a thousand
to fifteen hundred years. It might be wisest to set no
beginning at all, since our “First” period is only the first of
those which are determinable with present knowledge. Actually,
it may have been preceded by a still more primitive era on
which as yet no specific evidence is available. It can however
be suggested that by 2000 or 1500 B.C. the beginnings of native
Californian culture as we know it had already been made.</p>

<h3 id="section166">166. <span class="smcap">The Evidence of Archæology</span></h3>

<p>There is left as a final check on the problem of age a means
of attack which under favorable circumstances is sometimes the
most fruitful: archæological excavation, especially when it leads
to stratigraphic determination, that is, the finding of different
but superimposed layers. Unfortunately archæology affords
only limited aid in California—much less, for instance, than in
the Southwest. Nothing markedly stratigraphical has been discovered.
Pottery, which has usually proved the most serviceable
of all classes of prehistoric remains for working out sequences
of culture and chronologies, is unrepresented in the greater part
of California, and is sparse and rather recent in those southern
parts in which it does occur.</p>

<p>Still, archæological excavation has brought to light something.
It has shown that the ancient implements found in shellmounds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
and village sites in Southern California, those from the shores
of San Francisco Bay in Central California, and those along the
coast of Northwestern California, are distinct. Certain peculiar
types of artifacts are found in each of these regions, are found
only there, and agree closely with objects used by the modern
tribes of the same districts. For instance, prehistoric village
and burial sites in Northwestern California contain long blades
of flaked obsidian like those used until a few years ago by the
Yurok and Hupa. Sites in Southern California have brought
to light soapstone bowls or “ollas” such as the Spaniards a
century ago found the Gabrielino and Luiseño employing in
cooking and in jimsonweed administration. Both these classes
of objects are wanting from the San Francisco Bay shellmounds
and among the recent Central Californian tribes.</p>

<p>It may thus be inferred (1) that none of the four local cultures
was ever spread much more widely than at present; (2)
that each of them originated mainly on the spot; and (3) that
because many of the prehistoric finds lie at some depth, the local
cultures are of respectable antiquity—evidently at least a thousand
years old, probably more. This fairly confirms the estimate
that the differentiation of the local cultures of the Third
Period commenced not later than about 500 A.D.</p>

<h3 id="section167">167. <span class="smcap">Age of the Shellmounds</span></h3>

<p>Archæology also yields certain indications as to the total lapse
of time during the four periods. The deposits themselves contribute
the evidence. Some of the shellmounds that line the
ramifying shores of San Francisco Bay to the number of over
four hundred have been carefully examined. These mounds are
refuse accumulations. They were not built up with design, but
grew gradually as people lived on them year after year, because
much of the food of their inhabitants was molluscs—chiefly
clams, oysters, and mussels—whose shells were thrown outdoors
or trodden under foot. Some of the sites were camped on only
transiently, and the layers of refuse never grew more than a
few inches in thickness. Other spots were evidently inhabited
for many centuries, since the masses of shell now run more
than thirty feet deep and hundreds of feet long. The higher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
such a mound grew, the better it drained off. One side of it
would afford shelter from the prevailing winds. The more
regularly it came to be lived on, the more often would the inhabitants
bring their daily catch home, and, without knowing
it, thus help to raise and improve the site still further.</p>

<p>Some of these shellmounds are now situated high and dry,
at some distance above tide water. Others lie on the very edge
of the bay, and several of these, when shafts were sunk into
them, proved to extend some distance below mean sea level.
The base of a large deposit known as the Ellis Landing mound,
near Richmond, is eighteen feet below high tide level; of one on
Brooks island near by, seventeen feet. The conclusion is that
the sites have sunk at least seventeen or eighteen feet since they
began to be inhabited. The only alternative explanation, that
the first settlers put their houses on piles over the water, is
opposed by several facts. The shells and ashes and soil of the
Ellis Landing mound are stratified as they would be deposited
on land, not as they would arrange in water. There are no
layers of mud, remains of inedible marine animals, or ripple
marks. There is no record of any recent Californian tribe living
in pile dwellings; the shore from which the mound rises is unfavorably
situated for such structures, being open and exposed
to storms. Suitable timber for piles grows only at some distance.
One is therefore perforce driven to the conclusion that this
mound accumulated on a sinking shore, but that the growth of
the deposit was more rapid than the rise of the sea, so that the
site always remained habitable.</p>

<p>How long a time would be required for a coast to subside
eighteen feet is a question for geologists, but their reply remains
indefinite. A single earthquake might cause a sudden subsidence
of several feet, or again the change might progress at the rate
of a foot or only an inch a century. All that geologists are
willing to state is that the probability is high of the subsidence
having been a rather long time taking place.</p>

<p>The archæologists have tried to compute the age of Ellis
Landing mound in another way. When it was first examined
there were near its top about fifteen shallow depressions. These
appear to be the remains of the pits over which the Indians were
wont to build their dwellings. A native household averages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
about 7 inmates. One may thus estimate a population of about
100 souls. Numerous quadruped bones in the mound prove that
these people hunted; net sinkers, that they fished; mortars and
pestles, that they consumed acorns and other seeds. Accordingly,
only part of their subsistence, and probably the minor
part, was derived from molluscs. Fifty mussels a day for man,
woman, and child seem a fair estimate of what their shellfish
food is likely to have aggregated. This would mean that the
shells of 5,000 mussels would accumulate on the site daily.
Laboratory experiments prove that 5,000 such shells, with the
addition of the same percentage of ash and soil as occurs in the
mound, all crushed down to the same consistency of compactness
as the body of the mound exhibits, occupy a volume of a
cubic foot. This being the daily increment, the growth of the
mound would be in the neighborhood of 365 feet per year. Now
the deposit contains roughly a million and a quarter cubic feet.
Dividing this figure by 365, one obtains about 3,500 as the presumable
number of years required to accumulate the mound.</p>

<p>This result may not be accepted too literally. It is the result
of a calculation with several factors, each of which is only tentative.
Had the population been 200 instead of 100, the deposit
would, with the other terms of the computation remaining the
same, have built up twice as fast, and the 3,500 years would
have to be cut in half. On the other hand, it has been assumed
that occupation of the site was continuous through the year. Yet
all that is known of the habits of the Indians makes it probable
that the mound inhabitants were accustomed to go up into the
hills and camp about half the time. Allowance for this factor
would double the 3,500 years. All that is maintained for the
computed age is that it represents a conscientious and conservative
endeavor to draw a conclusion from all available sources
of knowledge, and that it seems to hit as near the truth as a
calculation of this sort can.</p>

<p>One verification has been attempted. Samples of mound material,
taken randomly from different parts, indicate that 14 per
cent of its weight, or about 7,000 tons, are ashes. If the mound
is 3,500 years old, the ashes were deposited at the rate of two
tons a year, or about eleven pounds daily. Experiments with
the woods growing in the neighborhood have shown that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
yield less than one per cent of ash. The eleven daily pounds
must therefore have come from 1,200 pounds of wood. On the
assumption, as before, that the population averaged fifteen families,
the one-fifteenth share of each household would be eighty
pounds daily. This is a pretty good load of firewood for a
woman to carry on her back, and with the Indians’ habit of
nursing their fires economically, especially along a timberless
shore, eighty pounds seems a liberal allowance to satisfy all their
requirements for heating and cooking. If they managed to get
along on less than eighty pounds per hut, the mound age would
be correspondingly greater.</p>

<p>This check calculation thus verifies the former estimate rather
reasonably. It does not seem rash to set down three to four
thousand years as the indicated age of the mound.</p>

<p>This double archæological conclusion tallies as closely as one
could wish with the results derived from the ethnological method
of estimating antiquity from the degree and putative rapidity
of cultural change. Both methods carry the First traceable
period back to about 1,500 or 2,000 B.C. After all, exactness is
of little importance in matters such as these, except as an indication
of certitude. If it could be proved that the first mussel
was eaten by a human being on the site of Ellis Landing in
1724 B.C., this piece of knowledge would carry interest chiefly
in proving that an exact method of chronology had been developed,
and would possess value mainly in that the date found
might ultimately be connectible with the dates of other events
in history and so lead to broader formulations.</p>

<h3 id="section168">168. <span class="smcap">General Serviceability of the Method</span></h3>

<p>The anthropological facts which have been analyzed and then
recombined in the foregoing pages are not presented with the
idea that the history of the lowly and fading Californians is of
particular intrinsic moment. They have been discussed chiefly
as an illustration of method, as one example out of many that
might have been chosen. That it was the California Indians
who were selected, is partly an accident of the writer’s familiarity
with them. The choice seems fair because the problem
here undertaken is rather more difficult than many. The Californian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
cultures were simple. They decayed quickly on contact
with civilization. The bulk of historical records go back
barely a century and a half. Archæological exploration has been
imperfect and yields comparatively meager results. Then, too,
the whole Californian culture is only a fragment of American
Indian culture, so that the essentially local Californian problems
would have been further illuminated by being brought into
relation with the facts available from North America as a whole—an
aid which has been foregone in favor of compact presentation.
In short, the problem was made difficult by its limitations,
and yet results have been obtained. Obviously, the same
method applied under more favorable circumstances to regions
whose culture is richer and more diversified, where documented
history projects farther back into the past, where excavation
yields nobler monuments and provides them in stratigraphic
arrangement, and especially when wider areas are brought into
comparison, can result in determinations that are correspondingly
more exact, full, and positive.</p>

<p>It is thus clear that cultural anthropology possesses a technique
of operation which needs only vigorous, sane, and patient
application to be successful. This technique is newer and as yet
less refined than those of the mechanical sciences. It is also
under the disadvantage of having to accept its materials as they
are given in nature; it is impossible to carry cultural facts into
the laboratory and conduct experiments on them. Still, it is a
method; and its results differ from those of the so-called exact
sciences in degree of sharpness rather than in other quality.</p>

<p>It will be noted that throughout this analysis there has been
no mention of laws; that at most, principles of method have been
recognized—such as the assumption that widely spread culture
elements are normally more ancient than locally distributed
ones. In this respect cultural anthropology is in a class with
political and economic history, and with all the essentially historical
sciences such as natural history and geology. The historian
rarely enunciates laws, or if he does, he usually means
only tendencies. The “laws” of historical zoölogy are essentially
laws of physiology; those of geology, laws of physics and
chemistry. Even the “laws” of astronomy, when they are not
mere formulations of particular occurrences which our narrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
outlook on time causes to seem universal, are not really astronomical
laws but mechanical and mathematical ones. In other
words, anthropology belongs in the group of the historical
sciences: those branches of knowledge concerned with things as
and how and when they happen, with events as they appear in
experience; whereas the group of sciences that formulates laws
devotes itself to the inherent and immutable properties of
things, irrespective of their place or sequence or occurrence in
nature.</p>

<p>Of course, there must be laws underlying culture phenomena.
There is no possibility of denying them unless one is ready to
remove culture out of the realm of science and set it into the
domain of the supernatural. Where can one seek these laws
that inhere in culture? Obviously in that which underlies culture
itself, namely, the human mind. The laws of anthropological
data, like those of history, are then laws of psychology.
As regards ultimate explanations for the facts which it discovers,
classifies, analyzes, and recombines into orderly reconstructions
and significant syntheses, cultural anthropology must look to
psychology. The one is concerned with “what” and “how”;
the other with “why”; each depends on the other and supplements
it.</p>

<h3 id="section169">169. <span class="smcap">Review of the Method of Culture Examination</span></h3>

<p>In a previous chapter (<a href="#CHAPTER_VII">VII</a>) it has been shown that culture
cannot be adequately explained either by the innate peculiarities
of racial stocks nor by the influences of geographic environment;
that the factors to be primarily considered in the interpretation
of civilization are cultural or social ones.</p>

<p>In a subsequent chapter (<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">VIII</a>) it was made clear that civilization
is to a great extent the result of accretion. New elements
are handed down in time or passed along in space by a process
which psychologically is one of imitation and in its cultural
manifestations is spoken of as tradition or diffusion. The chapters
on the arch and the week, and the alphabet (<a href="#CHAPTER_X">X</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">XI</a>) serve
as exemplifications that the principle holds with equal validity
in the domains of mechanical, institutional, and intellectual activity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
It must be accepted therefore purely as the consequence
of an objective or behavioristic examination of human civilization,
that while the element of invention or creative progress
remains unexplained, the factor of diffusion or imitation is the
one that is operative in the majority of cultural events. As contrasted
with it, instances of the principle of independent origin
or parallel development prove to be decidedly rare, and tend to
be illusory on searching analysis or to dissolve into only partial
similarities.</p>

<p>In the analysis of the growth of religion in native California
(Chapter <a href="#CHAPTER_XII">XII</a>), the attempt was made to apply an assumption
derived from the diffusion principle—the assumption that normally
the more widely spread element would be the more ancient—to
the unraveling of the growth of a civilization which on
account of its poverty has left no chronological records; in short,
to reconstruct the tentative history of a field lacking ordinary
historical data, by converting elements of space into elements of
time.</p>

<p>It may now be worth while to apply this method on a larger
scale and endeavor to outline the pre-Columbian history of the
western hemisphere, which, with some brief and late exceptions
in Mexico and Peru, is equally dateless. The cultural connections
of native America with the Old World are generally conceded
to have been slight: its civilization represents the most
important one that in the main developed independently of the
Eur-Asiatic nexus.</p>

<h3 id="section170">170. <span class="smcap">Limitations on the Diffusion Principle</span></h3>

<p>To essay, by the mere principle of converting spatial extent
into temporal duration, an accomplishment of such magnitude
and ultimately of such complexity as this, may seem simplistic;
and it would be. The distribution principle may be the most
useful of the weapons in the ethnologist’s armory. But it requires
supplement and qualification.</p>

later diffusion had not yet penetrated to the farthest ends. <i>D</i>, distribution
suggesting a single origin old enough for its diffusion to have
become extensive, but checked in certain directions by adverse conditions
in nature, communications, or cultural preoccupation. The specific
demonstration of such adverse factors would substantiate the interpretation.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span></p>

<p>First of all, it is obvious that spatial extension must not be
measured mechanically. To work on the assumption that a
custom or art practised over a million square miles was a third
as old again as one practised over seven hundred and fifty
thousand, would be too often contrary to the evidence of known
history as well as the dictates of reason. Culture traits do die
out, from inanition, from sterility of social soil, through supplanting
by more vigorous descendants. Continuity is therefore
not a necessary ingredient of geographical range. An
ancient trait may have been displaced in all but a few remote
peripheral tracts. The areas of these may aggregate but little.
Yet the distances between them are likely to remain greater than
the longest range of a later trait which has replaced the earlier
one over most of its original territory.</p>

<p>Thus, alphabetic writing is more recent than the ideographic
and rebus methods, but in the year 1500 A.D. was in use over
a larger area in Europe, Africa, and Asia than the surviving
Chinese and Mexican systems occupied. Yet these two outlying
systems enclosed between them a larger tract than those over
which the alphabets had diffused.</p>

<p>So, at the same period, was agriculture practised by peoples
holding more area than was occupied by non-agricultural ones.
But the former constituted two great and continuous groups, one
in each hemisphere, to which the non-agricultural peoples in the
north of Asia, the south of Africa, the remote continent of
Australia, the north of North America, and the south of South
America were obviously peripheral. Agriculture being of necessity
later than the non-agricultural state, and there being thus
no doubt that the marginal hunting peoples represent the remnant
of a condition that was once world-wide, it appears that
there must be a presumption of validity in favor of reckoning
the extent of a scattered custom by its included rather than its
actual area.</p>

<p>Of course, the situation is not always so simple. There may
exist the possibility of two or more marginal areas sharing a
trait as the result of parallelism. Half-hitch basketry coiling
in Tasmania and at Cape Horn might logically be the last survival
of a very ancient world-wide diffusion, or the product
of two thoroughly independent inventions, or of parallel processes
of degeneration in isolated and culturally unstimulated
nooks. The last two interpretations in fact seem more conservative
than the first. If half-hitch coiling were as antecedent in
its nature to other coiling and to weaving as wild foods are to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
cultivated ones; or if the Old Stone Age remains showed it to
have been actually so; or if it were practised by a considerable
number of tribes in four or five rather large marginal areas instead
of two quite narrow ones, diffusion, and the consequent
antiquity of the trait, could be inferred with high probability.
In short, the periphery argument must not be stretched too thin.</p>

<p>Obviously, too, comparables must be compared: coiling with
twining, hand-weaving with loom-weaving; not, however, the
very special variety of half-hitch coiling with the entire array
of weaving techniques. Nor would it be fair to balance the whole
group of true alphabets in the year 500 B.C. against the particular
rebus system of Egyptian hieroglyphs from which they
were possibly derived but which they had already much exceeded
in their diffusion. Yet the distribution of all alphabets as
against that of all ideographic and rebus systems would lead,
at that date as two thousand years later, to the same interpretation
that the facts of history actually give.</p>

<h3 id="section171">171. <span class="smcap">Cultural Ranking</span></h3>

<p>Consideration must also be allowed, within certain limits, to
cultural superiority and inferiority. This is a criterion that
has been abused in the earlier anthropology, but it is usable
with caution, especially where a measure of experience confirms
the grading that seems rational. A machine process would
normally be later than a manual one: cloth, for instance, subsequent
to basketry. The antiquity of both these products happens
to be so great that little or no direct historical evidence
exists, and their perishability precludes much help from archæology.
Yet there is this indirect evidence: there are peoples
that make baskets only, others that make baskets and cloth,
none that make cloth only. Cloth thus is something superadded,
which, not coming into competition of utility with basketry,
coexists with it.</p>

<p>Where two devices serve the same end and come into full contact,
the issue is even simpler, because the better crowds out the
worse. There is no record of any people, once able to produce
metal axes or knives, reverting to or inventing stone ones. An
adequate system of recording events has always maintained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
itself. Literacy may have become less frequent, now and then,
under economic or military stress, and literature poorer, but no
recording culture has ever gone back wholly to oral tradition.
Specific systems of records have indeed died out—witness Egyptian
and Cuneiform: but only because they were rendered useless
by more efficient systems of pure phonetic writing. These,
on the other hand, have never been known to yield to non-phonetic
systems.</p>

<p>It is very different with culture phenomena whose ranking
is based solely on the operation of our imaginations. In such
cases judgment should if possible be wholly suspended until
evidence is available. For fifty or sixty years it has seemed
eminently plausible and natural, even inevitable to most people,
that matrilinear institutions preceded patrilinear ones, because
a man must know his mother, but in a condition of promiscuity
would not know his father. Yet incontrovertible historical evidence
of a change is conspicuously deficient, so that the belief
in the antecedence of the matrilineate has remained founded
solely in hypothesis. As has been indicated above (§ <a href="#section110">110</a>) and
will be shown more in detail below (§ <a href="#section185">185</a>), the indirect evidence
of distribution indicates rather that definitely matrilinear and
patrilinear institutions have tended to be closely associated, and
that among exogamous and totemic peoples the matrilineate has
usually been the later phase.</p>

<p>In fact, one important stimulus to belief in matrilineal priority
has been the awareness that the most advanced cultures of the
recent period have inclined to count descent from the father.
But it is obviously unfounded to deduce from this that ancient
and primitive nations favored mother-reckoning. It would be
equally logical—or illogical—to infer that what is had always
been since institutions arose, as to argue that because a thing
is now it must formerly not have been.</p>

<p>This points to a further limiting consideration: that it is
dangerous to argue from a fraction of culture history to the
whole. Particularly dangerous is it to infer from the last four
centuries to all that went before. In the present era distant
communications have become infinitely more numerous and
rapid. Space has in one sense been almost abolished. Diffusions
that now encircle the planet in a hundred years would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
in previous ages often have required a thousand to cross a continent
by halting steps from people to people.</p>

<p>Similarly, the results of the diffusion principle may be vitiated
by an arbitrary bounding of the spatial field of investigation.
A review of African distributions by themselves, for instance,
would lead to many misleading conclusions, because it is obvious
that African culture has evolved not integrally but as a part of
the larger complex Europe-Asia-Africa. What from the angle
of Africa thus appears central, like iron, may really be
peripheral; what appears marginal, like Islam, is often actually
central. By comparison America is so discrete from the Old
World, both geographically and historically, that an analogous
attempt is far more justifiable. Yet even here, as will appear,
some influences from the Old World have operated, whose
a priori elimination would lead to false conclusions.</p>

<p>As regards what is high and low, whole cultures as well as
culture elements must be considered. Between two civilizations,
it is fair to assume that the more advanced will normally radiate,
the retarded one absorb. It is known that the drift of diffusion
was from western Asia to Greece in 800 B.C., from Greece to
western Asia in 300 B.C. In the case of a still unexplained
trait common to the two areas and limited to them, the presumption
of origin would thus lie in one or the other tract according
to whether its appearance fell in the period of Asiatic or Greek
culture domination. So in America, loom weaving is shared
by Mexicans and Pueblos. If nothing else were known of them
except that the former but not the latter had passed from oral
tradition to visible records, there would be justification for belief
in the probability of importation of the loom from Mexico into
the adjacent Southwest. Since this one item of Mexican superiority
is reinforced by the facts that the Mexicans cultivated
a dozen plants to the Pueblos’ three; that they were expert in
several metallurgical processes and the Pueblos at best, and
rarely, hammered native copper; that the Mexicans alone carried
on elaborate astronomical observations, computed with large
figures, and had established an intercommunal dominion, the
probability of their priority in loom weaving becomes so strong
as to serve as a fairly reliable working basis. Still, it is important
to remember that in the absence of the direct testimony<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
of history or archæology such a probability does not become a
certainty. The Greeks were without writing, metal working,
successful astronomy, or empire while these already flourished
in Egypt and Asia and were later carried to Greece. Yet in
this general period the Greeks developed metrical poetry and
vowel signs for the alphabet.</p>

<p>Another limitation to the regularity of the diffusion process
is to be found in the inability or unreadiness of undeveloped
culture to accept specialized products of more advanced civilizations;
and of any culture to accept traits incompatible with its
existing customs, except on severe or long continued pressure.
A backward tribe might adopt a simple iron-working technique
quite avidly, yet find the manufacture of sewing machines beyond
its endeavors and wants. Among a people owning little
property and no money and therefore not in the habit of counting,
and indifferent to their ages or the lapse of time as expressed
in numbers of years and days, a calendar system like that of
the Babylonians or Mayas would certainly not become established
merely because of contact. They might adopt and make
use of the knowledge that there are some twelve moons in the
round of the seasons, and that the solstices furnish convenient
starting points for the count within each year. But generations
and centuries of gradual preparation through acceptance of
such elementary fragments of the elaborate calendrical scheme
would ordinarily precede their ability to take the latter over in
completeness. So with a religion like Christianity or Buddhism
carried by a lone missionary, or shipwrecked sailors, to a people
as simple in their life as the Indians of California. The religion
would be too abstract, too remote, too dependent on unintelligible
preconceptions, to be embraced. A particular Christian or
Buddhist trait, say a symbol like the swastika or cross, might
conceivably be taken over and perpetuated as a decorative
motive or as a magical charm. True, if the missionary came in
the company of troops and settlers, and introduced cattle,
regular meals, comfortable clothing, intertribal peace, new occupations
and diversions, the old simple culture would often
crumble rapidly, and the higher religion be adopted as part of
the larger change, as indeed happened in California when the
Franciscans entered it. But one would not argue from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
convertibility of the Indians under such circumstances to their
equal readiness to accept Buddhism from sporadic East Asiatic
castaways.</p>

<h3 id="section172">172. <span class="smcap">Cultural Abnormalities</span></h3>

<p>Now and then a condition of cultural pathology must be discounted.
About 1889 a messianic religious movement known as
the Ghost-dance fired half the Indian tribes of the United
States for a few years. In 1891 this had a wider diffusion
than any ancient cult. It represented something struck from
the contact of two culture systems: it was not of pure native
evolution. A point had been reached where the old cultures
felt themselves suffocated by the wave of Caucasian immigration
and civilization. And in a last despairing delirium they flung
forth the delusion of an impending cataclysm that would wipe
out the white man with his labor, penalties, and restrictions,
bring back the extinct buffalo, and restore the old untrammeled
life. Such a cult could not of course have remained permanently
active. If analogous excitements occurred in the prehistoric
period, they died away without a trace and may therefore be
disregarded in a view of long perspective. Or at most they
served as ferments productive of other and more stable culture
growths. Even if all knowledge of American religion were
blotted out except its condition in 1891, the careful investigator
would stand in no serious danger of inferring a high antiquity
from the broad extent of the Ghost-dance cult, because of the
conspicuous elements which it purloined from that very Christianity
and Occidental civilization whose encroachments gave it
birth.</p>

<h3 id="section173">173. <span class="smcap">Environmental Considerations</span></h3>

<p>Two other qualifications on the distribution method must be
observed, although they are sufficiently obvious to carry no great
danger of oversight. The first concerns gaps or bounds due to
physical environment. Metallurgy will not be practised on an
isolated coral island. Snowshoes cannot be expected in equatorial
lowlands. The spread of the cultivation of a tropical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
plant like manioc is necessarily restricted no matter how great
the antiquity of its use. Limitations of diffusion, or breaks in
the continuity of distribution, thus do not count as negative
evidence if climate or soil suffice to explain them. This is in
accord with what has been previously formulated (§ <a href="#section83">83</a>) as to
environment being a limiting condition rather than a cause of
cultural phenomena.</p>

<p>Secondly, a marginal area need not be literally so. It may
actually be nuclear. Thus in the Philippines, older elements
of culture are best preserved in the interiors of the larger
islands. The coasts show many more imported traits. Communication
in the archipelago is by sea, internally as well as in
foreign relations; resistance to travel, conquest, intercourse, or
innovation is by land. The remote area as regards time may
therefore be a mountain range fifty miles inland, while a coast
a thousand miles away is near. So a rough hill tract in a level
territory, a desert encircled by fertile lands, sometimes remain
backward because they oppose the same obstacles to diffusion as
great distances.</p>

<p>It is thus evident that valuable as the distribution principle
is, perhaps most important of all non-excavating methods of prehistoric
investigation, it can never be used mechanically. It
must be applied with common sense, and with open-mindedness
toward all other techniques of attack. With these provisos in
mind, let us approach the problem of American culture.</p>

<h3 id="section174">174. <span class="smcap">Culture-areas</span></h3>

<p>The native cultures of the New World are signalized by the
two outstanding traits already alluded to. First, they have come
to us virtually in momentary cross section, flat and without
perspective. In general there are few historic data extant about
them. Second, they represent the civilizations of by far the
greatest geographical extent and highest attainment that have
developed independently, in the main at least, of the great web
of culture growths which appear to have had their principal
origin in the regions not far from the eastern Mediterranean.
They offer, accordingly, a separate problem, and one which, on
account of the dearth of temporal data, has had to be approached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
through the medium of space. As soon, therefore, as knowledge
of American cultures became orderly, its organization was inevitably
effected in terms of geography. The result has been
the recognition of a series of culture-areas or culture-centers,
several of which have already been referred to (§ <a href="#section150">150-152</a>).
These geographically defined types of culture are gradual and
empirical findings. They are not the product of a scheme or
imagination, nor the result of theory. They are not even the
formulation of any one mind. They do represent a consensus
of opinion as to the classification of a mass of facts, slowly
arrived at, contributed to by many workers, probably accepted
in exact identity by no two of them but in essential outlines by
all; in short, a non-philosophical, inductive, mainly unimpeachable
organization of phenomena analogous to the “natural”
classification of animals and plants on which systematic biology
rests.</p>

<p>These culture areas, centers, or types have been established
with greater exactitude for North than for South America.
The ten usually recognized (see <a href="#figure34">Fig. 34</a>) are:</p>

<p>1. Arctic or Eskimo: coastal</p>

<p>2. Northwest or North Pacific Coast: also a coastal strip</p>

<p>3. California or California-Great Basin</p>

<p>4. Plateau: the northern inter-mountain region</p>

<p>5. Mackenzie-Yukon: the northern interior forest and tundra
tract</p>

<p>6. Plains: the level or rolling prairies of the interior</p>

<p>7. Northeast or Northern Woodland: forested</p>

<p>8. Southeast or Southern Woodland: also timbered</p>

<p>9. Southwest: the southern plateau, sub-arid</p>

<p>10. Mexico: from the tropic to Nicaragua.</p>

<p>The only serious divergence of opinion as to distinctness or
approximate boundaries might arise in regard to numbers 4 and
5 of this list. The culture of the Mackenzie region is so deficient
and colorless that some students have hesitated to set it up
as a separate unit. The Plateau culture is also vague as to
positive traits. A plausible argument could be advanced apportioning
it between the adjacent Northwest, Plains, California,
and Southwest cultures. In fact, usage has here been departed
from in reckoning the Great Basin, that part of the plateau
which is without ocean drainage, with California instead of the
Plateau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span></p>

<p>The Mexican area is less homogeneous than any of the preceding.
At least three sub-centers must apparently be recognized
within it: those of the Nahua or Aztec, Zapotec, and Maya.
The Nahua were politically and economically dominant at the
time of discovery, but the Maya center is likely to be the oldest.
To it seems due most of the progress achieved in architecture,
sculpture, calendry, and writing. The sources of knowledge in
the Mexican area are historic and archæological rather than
contemporaneously ethnological, and are available through the
medium of Spanish writings. Also the phenomena are more
diverse and intricate, as is only natural with higher cultures.
The consequence is that they are scarcely as well ordered as
those from north of Mexico and have not yet been brought into
as close a comparable relation with the latter as these among
themselves.</p>

<p>South American cultures seem to arrange themselves on fewer
lines of cleavage than those of the northern continent. Only
five areas are as yet distinctly recognizable. This paucity is
perhaps due to a less intensive search for facts and less systematic
attempt to classify them, so that future studies may
increase the number of areas recognized. Yet a simplicity of
plan of culture relationships is evident. The narrow strip
between the Andes and the Pacific is a region of rather high
culture throughout, the whole remainder of the continent one
of much lower and comparatively uniform culture. The areas
determined are:</p>

<p>11. Colombia or Chibcha: western Colombia with the nearer
parts of Central America and northwestern Ecuador. This is
in the main a timbered region.</p>

<p>12. Andean or Peruvian: from southern Ecuador to northern
Chile and northwestern Argentina. This is distinctively an arid
to sub-arid and unforested belt.</p>

<p>13. Patagonia: characteristically an open, semi-arid country.</p>

<p>14. Tropical Forest: the vast Orinoco, Amazon, and La Plata
drainages, prevailingly lowland, humid, and containing the
greatest forest in the world. Three sub-regions stand out with
a certain ethnic differentiation, although the basis of their culture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
seems to be that of the woodland. They are: the savannahs
of the Guiana region; the highlands of eastern Brazil; the
Chaco, west of the middle La Plata system. All three of these
are open areas or only part timbered.</p>

<p>15. Antillean: the West Indies, including probably the Venezuela
coast. This culture was the earliest to perish in the New
World. It received the first shock of Caucasian discovery and
settlement, and its carriers had no hinterland to which to retreat.
It is therefore imperfectly known. Its closest affiliations
are with the preceding area. In fact, the Antillean may yet
prove only a subdivision of the Tropical Forest culture. In the
discussions that follow, it has been omitted, but can in the main
be understood as included in what is said of the Tropical Forest
area.</p>

<h3 id="section175">175. <span class="smcap">Diagrammatic Representation of Accumulation and Diffusion of Culture Traits</span></h3>

<p>The outstanding facts regarding these fourteen or fifteen
culture-areas can be most vividly presented in a table allotting
a column to each area. Roughly, at least, these columns can
follow one another in geographical order. In each column, then,
there might be entered all the culture traits found in its area.
If one culture were twice as rich or complex as another, the
double number of entries would pile up twice as high and
impress the eye.</p>

<p>Actually, such a procedure is hardly practicable. The number
of culture elements is too great. Often too there would be doubt
whether a feature should be reckoned as one or several. Metal
working comprises smelting, casting, forging, alloying, plating,
soldering, and welding. These are distinct techniques. Yet they
usually occur together or are all lacking. One tribe practises
simple two-ply twining. Another adds three-strand, diagonal,
and lattice twining and three-strand braiding, probably as developments
of the original two-strand process. As between two
adjacent or related basket-making peoples, this difference may
be very significant; measured against cloth weaving, it is trivial.</p>

<p>Accordingly, in order to render the data more easily apperceived
and conceptualized, only the more fundamental aspects<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
of arts and institutions have been included in the diagram (<a href="#figure35">Fig.
35</a>), plus some that perhaps involve intrinsically less significant
principles or faculties, but were of particular importance in the
life of the peoples following them, such as the tipi or skin tent
of the Plains tribes. This means that a necessarily subjective
selection of traits has been made in the compilation of the table.
But the reader who is not a specialist in the matter will generally
be grateful for the elimination; and this elimination has
at least been conducted without a conscious bias in any one
direction. If anything, it would seem that the selective condensation
has operated against the preëminence of the advanced
areas. With every possible datum inserted, the peaks in the
table would probably overshadow the valleys much more conspicuously.</p>

<p>Accepting the diagram, then, as affording an approximately
truthful picture, it is obvious that much the greatest advancement
took place in Middle America—the region from Mexico to
Peru; and that on the whole the majority of culture traits found
in any of the more backward areas are shared with this middle
region. These are the traits below the heavy line that steps up
and down across the diagram. A minority of traits—those above
the heavy line—are local to the several areas. On the basic
principle that a trait occurring over a continuous territory may
be assumed to have originated but once and to have spread by
diffusion, the bulk of the culture of most of the areas must have
come into them from outside. On the principle that a people
with many established arts is more likely to make a new invention
than is a retarded people, the great majority of the diffused
elements may therefore be attributed to a Middle American
source. In this region, then, lay the focal point, the hive,
of American civilization. From it, the tribes of the Lower
Amazon and the upper Mississippi equally derived most of the
limited culture which they possessed.</p>

which towers impressively in Middle America, to fall away towards the
peripheries. Hatching indicates elements that may once have existed in

Asia. Entries above the heavy line are local developments.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In South America, the diffusion proceeded broadside from
the length of the Andes. In North America, it radiated fanwise
from the south Mexican angle, the Southwest serving as
the gateway or first relaying station that let through most but
not all of what it received. One area alone, the Northwest
Coast, was reached but imperfectly by Middle American influences,
yet attained a tolerable development through its own
creative force, supplemented in some measure by the drift into
it of sporadic culture element migrants from Asia. Here only,
then, there occurred a markedly independent growth of civilization,
though definitely secondary to the great evolution of Middle
America which in the main determined the culture of the twin
continents.</p>

<h3 id="section176">176. <span class="smcap">Representation Showing Contemporaneity and Narrative Representation</span></h3>

<p>So far as possible, the traits in each column of the diagram
have been disposed in the order of their presumptive appearance
in time. In the lowest level, for instance, have been set those
elements that are likely to have been common to all the first
immigrants into America. Local developments tending on the
whole to be late, have been placed toward the heads of columns;
and, roughly throughout, widely diffused and therefore apparently
early elements are nearer the bottom. In general, accordingly,
the sequence upward of traits indicates their approximate
sequence in time. But this arrangement obviously holds chiefly
for each column as a unit. As between the columns, it breaks
down, since the top of each column would represent the same
period, the moment of discovery, and these tops are not on a
level.</p>

<p>The display of the same data in such a manner that vertical
position would adequately represent proportional lapse of time
as the horizontal placing suggests geographical contiguity,
would necessitate another arrangement. In such a diagram
the height of each column would be the same, but the richer
cultures would have their constituent elements more closely
crowded. That is, each new invention or institution or importation
followed more rapidly on its predecessor than in the
peripheral areas. For instance, while maize agriculture was
spreading from Middle America to the Southwest and thence to
the Northeast, the Middle Americans were adding varied agriculture
and metallurgy, human sacrifice, and astronomy. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
strata in the diagram would therefore generally not be level
but would slope upward from their origin in the middle. This
would be a more accurate schematic representation of what
happened.</p>

<p>On the other hand, difficulties would arise in the graphic
representation. The domestication of the llama, for instance,
is confined to a single area, the Andean. Yet the domestication
is rather ancient, as archæological discoveries prove; perhaps
older than the spread of many culture elements from the Andes
into the Tropical Forest, or from Mexico into the United States.
The llama could therefore not be placed properly near the head
of the column representing Andean culture, because the top
of this column would signify recency. It would have to be
inserted lower down, thus breaking the continuity of strata
extending through several areas. Thus the diagram would
quickly become so intricate as to lose its graphic value.</p>

<p>It would simplify the problem if the large mass of culture
elements could be segregated into a small number of groups,
each assignable to a stratum or period, much as the constituents
of the religion and then of the whole culture of the California
Indians were analyzed and then regrouped in the preceding
chapter. Such a procedure, however, is much easier and more
accurate for the subdivisions of one limited area than for an
entire hemisphere, because the interrelations of the areas constituting
this are naturally very complex and at many points
imperfectly known. Such a schematic representation of the
course of culture in the whole of the Americas on the basis of
as many traits as are included in <a href="#figure35">Figure 35</a>, is therefore not
attempted here. Instead, there is reproduced an analogous but
simpler scheme (<a href="#figure36">Fig. 36</a>) recently published by an author whose
primary concern is with Middle America, who has presented
his story in the form of a treatment by larger periods, and in
his diagram extends these to the remainder of the two continents.
If his figure seems different from the preceding one, it
should be remembered that the two approaches are not only
from somewhat different angles but independent of each other,
besides which it will be found that the divergence between the
two illustrations (Figs. <a href="#figure35">35</a> and <a href="#figure36">36</a>) is more apparent than intrinsic.</p>

peopling of the continent a few thousand years back of the time assumed in this book, it is in substantial agreement with the views expressed

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span></p>

<p>At best, however, all diagrams are not only schematic but
static; and it may accordingly be worth while to try to narrate
some of the principal events of the history of American civilization
in order to bring out their continuity and relations as they
appear in perspective. But the reader must remember that this
is a reconstruction from indirect and often imperfect evidence,
probably correct in the large and in many details, certain to be
incorrect in some proportion of its findings, tentative throughout
and subject to revision as the future brings fuller insight. It
aims to give the truth as it can be pieced together: it is never
a directly documented story like those familiar to us from
orthodox “history.”</p>

<h3 id="section177">177. <span class="smcap">Racial Origin of the American Indians</span></h3>

<p>The American race can hardly have come from anywhere else
than Asia: it entered the New World perhaps ten thousand years
ago. Its affiliations, as previously set forth (§ <a href="#section23">23</a>, <a href="#section25">25</a>) are
generically Mongoloid. This statement does not mean that the
American Indians are descended from the Chinese or Japanese,
any more than the fact that these are denominated Mongolians
implies belief in their descent from the particular modern
people known as the Mongols. We call ourselves Caucasians
without any intimation that our ancestors lived in the Caucasus
mountains or that the present inhabitants of the Caucasus
are a purer and more representative stock than we.
So the Mongolians are that group of “yellow” peoples of
eastern Asia of whom the Mongols form part; and the Mongoloids
are the larger group that takes in Mongolians, East Indians,
and Americans. From the original proto-Mongoloid stem,
all three divisions and their subdivisions have sprung and differentiated.
The American Indians have probably remained
closer to it than the Chinese. It would be more correct to say
that the Chinese have developed out of an ancient Indian-like
stock, acquiring slant eyes rather late.</p>

<p>The proto-Mongoloid stem must be ten thousand years old.
It is probably much older. In the Aurignacian period, the
third from the last in the Old Stone Age, twenty-five thousand
or so years ago, possibly longer, the two other great types of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
living men were already rather well characterized. The fossil
Grimaldi race of this period shows pretty clear Negroid affinities;
the contemporary Cro-Magnon race can probably be reckoned
as proto-Caucasian. It is therefore probable, although as
yet unproved by discoveries, that the proto-Mongoloids were also
already in existence.</p>

<h3 id="section178">178. <span class="smcap">The Time of the Peopling of America</span></h3>

<p>About the end of the Palæolithic or beginning of the Neolithic
some of these proto-Mongoloids drifted from Asia into
North America. These were probably the real discoverers of
the New World, which they found inhabited only by brutes.
The time of their invasion can be but roughly fixed, yet within
its limits it seems fairly reliable. Had the migration occurred
much later, when the Neolithic was already well under way, the
domesticated animals and plants of the Old World would have
been introduced—cattle, pigs, sheep, wheat, barley, rice, millet,
all of which the Americans lacked. The same holds for inventions
like the wheel.</p>

<p>Analogous arguments weigh against a belief in a possible
earlier peopling of America, say in the middle Palæolithic. In
that event there ought to be cave or rock shelter or river terrace
deposits corresponding to those of Europe in containing only
implements of Palæolithic type. But none such have been found
in America, or where alleged, their circumstances have remained
matters of controversy.</p>

<p>Further, if Palæolithic man had inhabited the western hemisphere,
it is likely that his fossil remains would have come to
light. There has been much excavation, and numerous investigators
are alive to the importance which evidence of this sort
would bear. Yet to date not a single human fossil of positively
Pleistocene age or type has been discovered. Numerous sensational
finds have been announced. But in every case their geological
matrix or stratum has been proved either recent or open
to doubt. And not a single fragment of a skeleton of Neandertal
type, or one equally different from modern man, is on
record from America. Every once alleged Pleistocene skull or
part appears to belong to some branch of the American Indian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
race as it exists to-day. It is therefore unlikely that man
reached America before the last stage of the Palæolithic.</p>

<p>If the date of the entry is set at ten thousand years ago, the
elapsed period accounts very well for the present diversification
of the American race. There are broad and narrow headed
tribes, tall and short ones, some with hooked noses, others with
slightly wavy hair. But the fundamental type is everywhere the
same. The differences seem just such as environment and mode
of life, the accidents of descent from small groups, and perhaps
a slight effect of selection, would be certain to accomplish in
time. In general, the natives of America are remarkably homogeneous,
considering the vast territory they occupy, its variations
of temperature, humidity, altitude, and food supply, and
the marked differences in the living customs of many tribes.
The one group that at all stand apart are the Eskimo; and these
are distinct in language and culture also. Moreover, they occupy
the parts nearest to Asia, including both sides of Behring
Strait. Thus they seem to represent a separate origin. But
all the other groups from Alaska to Patagonia are so closely
related somatically, that no comprehensive and generally accepted
sub-classification of them has yet been possible. In fact,
the American race seems almost too undifferentiated to require
ten thousand years for its superficial diversifications; until it
is remembered that human races left to themselves seem in most
cases to alter rather slowly. Mixture is one of the greatest
factors of racial change, and in the isolation of America this
element was eliminated to a much larger extent than in most
of the Old World.</p>

<h3 id="section179">179. <span class="smcap">Linguistic Diversification</span></h3>

<p>Language tells a similar story. The American Indian languages
certainly appear to be diverse. It has been customary
to reckon about a hundred and fifty distinct speech families in
North and South America (§ <a href="#section50">50</a>). But many of these are imperfectly
known; of late several Americanist philologists have
been inclined to see definite resemblances between numerous
tongues that are superficially different. Buried and disguised
resemblances are being noted, which point to original unity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
Thus the number of genetically distinct families or language
stocks is shrinking. The number to be ultimately recognized
bids fair to be small.</p>

<p>Old World conditions are at bottom more similar than at first
glance seems. English and the modern Hindu languages, such
as Bengali, although certainly related, are quite different from
each other. The proof of their common Indo-European origin
rests largely on the similarities between their ancestral forms,
Anglo-Saxon and Sanskrit. These in turn are tied together
more closely by the connecting evidence of other ancient languages,
such as Greek and Latin. Take away these extinct
tongues and the modern transitional ones, imagine English and
Bengali to be the only representatives of Indo-European, and
it is doubtful whether their common parentage could be wholly
proved. The relationship would certainly not be readily recognizable;
the most painstaking analysis would reveal so many words
wholly peculiar to each language, and so many exceptions to
every suggestion of regular sound equivalences, that conservative
philologists would perhaps refuse to commit themselves on
the problem of a single origin.</p>

<p>This imaginary situation parallels the actual one in American
linguistics. Not a single ancient form of speech has been preserved.
Many living ones are inadequately known. The fact
that some enthusiast has compiled a grammar of Nahuatl or
Quechua or Eskimo does not necessarily mean that he has dissected
out its whole structure. A book devoted to a language
may be as superficial as it looks learned. And the man who
really knew Nahuatl has usually concerned himself very little
with Quechua. So far as he might become acquainted with it,
it would appear so different that the pressing of comparisons
would seem sterile. Thus the great diversity of American languages
came to be accepted not because any one believed it to
have been really established, but because until recently no
critical scholar considered himself able to establish serious connections.
It has been a case of unproved rather than disproved
unity of origin.</p>

<p>If the Indo-European languages were not our own but those
of a strange race and therefore known to us much less intensively;
if the history of their ancient forms were obliterated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
instead of preserved for us for over three thousand years; and
if they were allowed a period of ten thousand years in which
to have differentiated, philology would probably be assigning
them to several distinct stocks. Multiply by three the amount
of difference which Bengali shows from Sanskrit, and by six
that of English from Anglo-Saxon, and a degree of divergence
might be attained roughly comparable to that between Nahuatl
and Quechua, or Maya and Iroquois. This is not an assertion
that Nahuatl and Quechua are related. It is a claim that in the
light of present knowledge they might have been one language
ten thousand years ago. A single people with a single speech
could well have given rise in so long a period as that—three
hundred generations—to languages that now seem so different.</p>

<p>And at that, there is no reason for believing that all the
American languages are necessarily derivable from a single
mother tongue. There might have been half-a-dozen or a dozen
idioms in use among as many populations which moved out of
Asia into Alaska. For of course it is improbable that the migration
was an isolated, unitary event. More likely it filled a period
of some length, during which a succession of waves of population
lapped from one continent into the other. Each of these
waves, which only the perspective of ages has merged into the
appearance of a single movement, may have brought its own
speech, from which in time there branched out languages that
ultimately became so differentiated as to appear now like distinct
families. Not that it is known that this happened; but it
seems inherently plausible that it might have happened, and
there is no present evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>In short, philology interposes no obstacle to the acceptance
of the date which has been assumed as roughly defining the
period of the peopling of America.</p>

<h3 id="section180">180. <span class="smcap">The Primitive Culture of the Immigrants</span></h3>

<p>As to the culture the immigrants brought with them, direct
testimony being lacking, it is necessary to fall back on the working
hypothesis that this culture was about the equivalent of the
most backward American culture of to-day; or, better, of the
common denominator of all American cultures, including the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
lowest. This procedure yields the group of elements entered
in the bottommost layer of <a href="#figure35">Figure 35</a>. These elements were
either brought along on the invasions or developed so soon afterwards
as to become equally widely diffused. The harpoon, for
instance, was used in Europe in the Magdalenian—at the close
of the Palæolithic. For the bow and arrow, there is no proof
in Europe until the opening of the Neolithic. The dog, the
earliest animal attached to man, is known from the same period,
whereas cattle, swine, and sheep were kept only at the height
of the Neolithic (§ <a href="#section67">67</a>, <a href="#section222">222</a>). As the American Indians possess
dogs, it is difficult to attribute the custom otherwise than to a
heritage from the same culture stage in the Old World to which
the harpoon and bow belong. This connection is made more
certain by the fact that the Indian dog is most closely related
not to the specifically American coyote but to the circumpolar
wolf and perhaps the jackal, and diverged into much the same
types of breeds as the Old World dog. There are American
races of dogs—some of them ancient, as represented by skeletons
from mounds, and mummies from Arizona and Peru—that are
respectively droop eared, curly tailed, short legged, long furred,
hairless, or undershot in the jaw, thus corresponding closely to
the breeds evolved with similar traits in the eastern hemisphere,
and virtually forcing the conclusion that the dog was brought
into America by man and not domesticated from a wild species
in this continent.</p>

<p>Such evidence as this it is that yields the period indicated—the
closing stages of the Palæolithic or earliest Neolithic—as the
time of man’s entry into America. The ten thousand years set
as the lapse since this event are admittedly more arbitrary.
No one pretends to date the remoter stages of European prehistory
exactly. Relative durations are all that it is legitimate
to pin much faith on. Dates are avowedly approximations. The
estimate here chosen for the end of the Paleolithic is 8000 B.C.—ten
thousand years ago. This round number, not taken too
literally, has the virtue of concreteness and seems somewhere
near the truth. It may yet prove to be a few thousand years
short or over. But it does allow enough time, and no obtrusive
excess of time, for the diversification of the Indians in race,
speech, and culture; and this seeming accord of the assumption<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
with the present facts may be taken as a rough corroboration.</p>

<p>The other culture elements assigned in <a href="#figure35">Figure 35</a> to the first
or immigrant stratum cannot be dated by any concrete remains,
since some are institutions and others are arts whose materials
are perishable—baskets and fire-drills, for instance. They are,
however, found among all or most of the lower American tribes,
and recur more or less widely in the eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p>The first settlers may accordingly be pictured as a people
living off nature; hunting, fishing, gathering roots and fruits
and seeds, digging or picking shellfish. Their best weapons
were the bow and the harpoon with detachable head. The latter
may already have been propelled by the atlatl or spear-thrower,
an artificial extension of the arm. Simpler weapons were also
used: clubs, stones, probably darts and spears, perhaps daggers
of bone or stone. Flint was chipped and flaked, other stones
were beginning to be ground or rubbed into form. Bone awls
served for piercing; less certainly, eyed needles for sewing.
Cordage of bast was twisted, and in all likelihood baskets, bins,
weirs, traps were woven or twined, perhaps also nets made.
Dogs were alternately played with and kicked about; they were
half kept, half tolerated, probably eaten in time of need. There
was no organization of society but on a basis of blood and contiguity.
Related groups would act together until they fell apart.
Labor was sex allotted; the men of each community possibly
maintained a house or place of meeting at which they gathered
in their leisure, perhaps nightly, and which women feared to
enter. Beliefs in souls and spirits were already immemorially
old. The people had risen to the point of being no longer passive
toward the immaterial; the most intense-minded among them
aspired to communication with the spirits; they demonstrated
to their fellows their control and utilization of supernatural
beings, and were what we call shamans. Custom in fact conceded
the influence of the spiritual world on every human being,
and felt it to be strongest at times of passage or crisis—birth,
maturity, death. Puberty in particular seemed important, as
portentous of the whole of adult life. The welfare of the individual
and his proper relation to the community were therefore
sought to be insured by spiritual safe-guarding. Girls were
secluded, treated or doctored, trained; boys subjected to whipping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
or other ordeals of fortitude; the passing of such initiation
admitted them to the men’s house.</p>

<h3 id="section181">181. <span class="smcap">The Route of Entry into the Western Hemisphere</span></h3>

<p>With such background man entered America at Behring
Strait. He may have navigated; more likely, or more often, he
crossed on the ice. The water distance is only about sixty miles;
the Diomede islands lie near the middle of the gap; and the
ice may have extended across pretty continuously, ten thousand
years nearer the peak of the last glaciation. Long before, there
had been a land bridge from Siberia to Alaska, by which horses,
camels, cattle, elephants, deer and many other species extended
their range from one continent to another. But this was in
geological antiquity, man’s entry in geological recency—immediacy,
rather; and the divided configuration of the continents
was probably already established. Horses had become extinct
in the New World when man arrived, the elephant tribe probably
also. Llamas, pumas, jaguars took the place of Old World
camels, lions, tigers. The fauna of the Americas, their vegetation,
their climate, were nearly as they are to-day.</p>

<p>The Aleutian islands have also been suggested as a migration
route. But their chain is long, the gap at the western end one
of hundreds of miles of open water, scarcely negotiable except
to rather expert navigators. Still weaker would be any supposition
of arrival from Polynesia. Here the distances between
the nearest islands and the mainland run to thousands of miles.
Only well-equipped voyagers could survive, and there is nothing
to prove positively that even late Palæolithic man had boats.
Further, all the Polynesian evidence points to a late settling of
the eastern islands of the Pacific; a few thousand years ago
at most. Exclusion therefore indicates the Behring route as the
only one to be seriously considered.</p>

<p>The migration was scarcely a sudden or single one. It went
on for generations, perhaps for thousands of years in driblets.
Two or three explorers would set across and return, to be followed
by a few families. Others succeeded them. There would
be no crowding, for a long time no resistance at the strait on
the part of jealous established settlers. The open south, always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
milder, generally more fruitful the farther one went, lay ahead.
It must long have drawn immigrants away from the strait faster
than they crossed it. Some of the invading bands almost certainly
differed from one another in customs, perhaps perceptibly
in appearance, though of one general level of culture.</p>

<h3 id="section182">182. <span class="smcap">The Spread Over Two Continents</span></h3>

<p>Before them lay fifteen million miles of tundra, forest, plains,
sea coast, desert, savannah, jungle, and plateaux, rich in this or
that food, with no occupant to dispute possession or block travel
but bear, wolf, puma, and jaguar—timid beasts compared with
those of the Old World. So the immigrants pushed across the
breadth of the continent and down its length, entered the tropics
in Mexico, defiled through Panama—and a second continent
stretched before them. How long it took the first wanderers to
diffuse themselves from Alaska to the Strait of Magellan, it is
impossible to say. Perhaps a couple of thousand years, perhaps
only a few hundred. Curiosity, the desire to see, are strong in
men if fear imposes no restraints.</p>

<p>Sooner or later, at any rate, they were living throughout both
continents. The advance guard had long lost knowledge of the
rear, if indeed the rear did not arrive until after the advance
could progress no farther. When the Caucasian discovered
America he might have commenced at Cape Horn, gone on to a
people whose very existence was unknown to those at his starting
point, and repeated the step a dozen times until his journey
brought him to the Arctic. Before the rise of the empires of
Mexico and Peru the number of links in the chain ignorant of
each other would have been greater. The moving bands of the
primitive first-comers no doubt lost touch with each other
quickly in even shorter stretches. Thus diversities of speech, of
mode of life, would become established. A family of brothers
might become dominant in a band through the number of their
descendants and so color the somatic type of the group, which
in turn, favored by fortune and expanding, might lay the
hereditary foundation for a sub-racial variety.</p>

<p>Movements of population continued to occur until the present.
The maps of speech stocks previously presented (Figs. <a href="#figure14">14</a>, <a href="#figure15">15</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
prove that distant migrations took place after great groups like
Athabascan, Algonkin, Uto-Aztecan, Arawak, Tupi, had each
lived in compact coherence long enough to establish a well
defined language. But so far as these more recent migrations
can be traced from speech, they no longer trended prevailingly
from north to south and west to east as the first general diffusion
must have moved, but shifted in the greatest variety of
direction. They are a sort of boiling of the kettle, not a downhill
flow. They relieved internal strains and vacillated back and
forth with circumstances; they represented no drift like the first
occupation. Much of their story may ultimately be worked out
and provide a national history of pre-Columbian America. But
the effect of these later pressures and expansions and wanderings
on the culture development of the New World as a whole is
likely to have been relatively slight.</p>

<h3 id="section183">183. <span class="smcap">Emergence of Middle American Culture: Maize</span></h3>

<p>For perhaps five thousand years little of wide significance
happened in America. There may have been progress, but it was
slow, and in the long perspective of time its slender evidences
are not yet determinable. One can affirm little of this early
period except that differences in culture must have begun to
develop in conformity with the localized opportunities of
environment.</p>

<p>But by the end of the first half of the duration of American
antiquity, let us guess somewhere about 3000 B.C., a perceptible
differentiation appears to have taken place between the culture
of the Middle American<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> highland and the remainder of the
Americas. The highland had forged ahead. Especially, perhaps,
was this true of the region of southern Mexico and Guatemala.
Why it was here that civilization first gathered a notable
momentum, it is difficult to say; we are dealing with obscure
beginnings at a remote period. An unusual concentration of
population is likely to have been an important factor. This in
turn may have rested on the ease of existence in a sub-tropical
area. Advanced civilizations in general find their greatest opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
in fairly temperate environment; incipient ones in
semi-tropical climates or unforested regions in the tropics. At
least there are the parallels of Egypt, Babylonia, India. Possibly
the environmental feature of greatest value to cultural
progress in Middle America was its diversity. Mountain and
coast, temperate highland and hot lowland, humid and arid
tracts, tropical jungle and open country, were only a few hours
apart. In each locality the population worked out its necessary
adaptations, and yet it was near enough others of a different
adaptation for them to trade, to depend on one another, to
learn. Custom therefore came in contact with custom, invention
with invention. The discrepancies, the very competitions,
would lead to reconciliations, readaptations, new combinations.
Cultural movement and stimulus would normally be greater
than in a culturally uniform area.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Middle America took the lead. It is in the
region of southern Mexico that a wild maize grows—teocentli,
“divine maize,”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> the Aztecs called it. From this, in a remote
archaic period, the cultivated plant was derived. At least, such
seems to be the probability in a somewhat tangled mass of
botanical evidence. Here then the dominant plant of American
agriculture was evolved: with it, very likely, the cultivated
beans and squashes that are generally associated in native
farming even in parts remote from Mexico.</p>

<p>Pottery has so nearly the same distribution as maize agriculture,
as to suggest a substantially contemporaneous origin,
probably at the same center. This is the more likely because the
art is of chief value to a sessile people, and farming operates
more strongly than any other mode of life to bring about a
sedentary condition.</p>

<p>Agriculture almost certainly increased the population. The
food supply was greater and more regular; people got used to
living near each other where before they had unconsciously
drifted apart through distrust; and the proximity in turn, as
well as the new stability, would lessen many of the local famines,
hostilities, and other hardships to which the smaller and less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
settled communities had been exposed. As the death rate went
down and numbers mounted, specialization of labor would be
first made possible, and then almost forced. A self-contained
community of a hundred cannot permit much specialization of
accomplishment and none of occupation. Every man must be
first of all an immediate food getter. On the other hand a community
of a million inevitably segregates somewhat into classes,
trades, guilds, or castes. The individual with decided tastes and
gifts in a particular direction finds his products in enough demand
to devote himself largely or wholly to their manufacture.
The very size of the community as it were forces him to specialization,
and thus diversity, with its train of effects leading
to further stimulation, is attained independently of environment.</p>

<h3 id="section184">184. <span class="smcap">Tobacco</span></h3>

<p>For some culture elements, the evidence of early origin in
Middle America is less direct. The use of tobacco, for instance,
is as widely spread as agriculture, but is not necessarily as
ancient. Its diffusion in the eastern hemisphere has been so
rapid (§ <a href="#section98">98</a>) as to make necessary the admission that it might
have spread rapidly in the New World also—faster, at any rate,
than maize. Moreover, a distinction must be made between the
smoking or chewing or snuffing of tobacco and its cultivation.
There are some modern tribes—mostly near the margins of the
tobacco area—that gather the plant as it grows wild. It is
extremely probable that wild tobacco was used for some time
before cultivation was attempted. Nevertheless tobacco growing,
whenever it may have originated, evidently had its beginning
in the northern part of Middle America, either in Mexico or the
adjacent Antillean province. It is here that <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>
was raised. The tribes to the north contented themselves with
allied species, mostly so inferior from the consumer’s point of
view that they have not been taken up by western civilization.
These varieties look like peripheral substitutes for the central
and original <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i>.</p>

<p>The Colombian and Andean culture-areas used little or no
tobacco, but chewed the stimulating coca leaf. This is a case<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
of one of two competing culture traits preventing or perhaps
superseding the other, not of tobacco never having reached the
Andes. Most of the remainder of South America used tobacco.</p>

<h3 id="section185">185. <span class="smcap">The Sequence of Social Institutions</span></h3>

<p>The most peripheral and backward peoples of both North and
South America even to-day remain without clans, moieties,
hereditary totems, or exogamic groupings (§ <a href="#section110">110</a>). Some of
these, like the Eskimo and Fuegians, live at the extreme ends
of the continents, under conditions of hardships which might
be imagined to have directed all their energies toward the material
sides of life and thus left over little interest for the development
of institutions. But this argument will not apply to the
many clanless tribes of the California, Plains, and Tropical
Forest areas. It must accordingly be concluded that those
American nations that show no formal organization of society
on a hereditary basis—or at least the more primitive ones who
possess no equivalent or substitute—do without this organization
because they never acquired it. This negative condition
may then be inferred as the original one of the whole American
race.</p>

<p>Somewhat more advanced culturally, on the whole, and less
definitely marginal, at any rate in North America, are several
series of tribes that do possess exogamic groups—either sibs or
moieties—in which descent goes in the male line and is generally
associated with totemic beliefs or practices. These comprise the
tribes of one segment of the Northwest Coast area; those of
one end of the Southwest with some extension into California;
and those of most of the Northern Woodland, with some extension
into the Plains.</p>

<p>Another series of tribes live under the same sort of organization
but with descent reckoned in the female instead of the male
line. These comprise the peoples of one end of the Northwest
Coast; those of one portion of the Southwest; and those of the
Southeast, with some extensions into the Northeast and
Plains.</p>

<p>These exogamic-totemic series of tribes average higher in their
general culture than the clanless and totemless ones. On the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
whole, too, they are situated nearer the focus of civilization in
Middle America. As between the two exogamic-totemic series
the matrilinear tribes must be accredited with a more complex
and better organized culture than the patrilinear ones. The
finest carving in North America, for instance, is that of the
Northwest—totem poles, masks, and the like. Within the Northwest,
the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian—matrilinear tribes—excel
in the quality of this work. They far surpass the patrilinear
Kwakiutl and Salish. So in the Southwest: the matrilinear
Pueblos build stone towns, obey a priestly hierarchy, and
possess an elaborate series of cult societies. The patrilinear
Pimas and southern Californians live in villages of brush or
earth-covered houses, are priestless, and know at most a single
religious society. Again, the matrilineal Southern Woodlanders
had made some approach to a system of town life and political
institutions, the patrilineal Northern Woodlanders did without
any serious institutions in these directions. The one Northeastern
group that established a successful political organization,
the Iroquois with their League of the Five Nations, were matrilinear
among patrilinear neighbors and possessed positive affiliations
with the Southeast.</p>

<p>It would be extravagant to maintain that throughout the
North American continent every matrilineal tribe was culturally
more advanced than every patrilineal one. But it is clear that
within each area or type of culture the matrilineal tribes manifest
superiority over the patrilineal tribes in a preponderance
of cultural aspects. The matrilineal clan organization thus represents
a higher and presumably later stage in North America
than patrilineal clan organization, as this in turn ranks and
temporally follows the clanless condition.</p>

<p>With one exception, the distribution of the same tribes with
reference to the South Mexican center agrees with their advancement.
The Northeast is distinctly peripheral, the Southeast
a half-way tract connected with Mexico by way both of the
Southwest and the Antilles. The matrilineal Pueblo portion of
the Southwest occupies part of the plateau backbone near the
southern end of which the Mexican culture developed. It was
along this backbone that civilization flowed up through northern
Mexico. The coasts lagged behind. They were marginal in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
Mexico, more marginal still in the Southwest, where the patrilineal
tribes lived on or near the Pacific.</p>

<p>The one exception is in the Northwest Coast, where the more
remote northerly tribes are matrilinear, the nearer southerly
ones patrilinear. This reversed distribution raises the suspicion
that the Northwestern social organization may have had
nothing to do with Mexico, but may be a purely local product.
This suspicion is hardened by the fact that the Northwest shows
a number of other culture traits—some peculiar to itself, others
recurring in well separated areas—which it seems impossible to
connect with Mexico. Several of these traits will be discussed
farther on. For the present it is enough to note their existence
as an indication favorable to the interpretation of the Northwest
social organization as unrelated to Mexico. Thus the abnormal
matrilineal-patrilineal distribution in the Northwest is
no bar to the generic finding for North America that clanless,
patrilinear, and matrilinear organizations of society rank in
this order both as regards developmental sequence and distance
from Middle America.</p>

<p>For South America the data are too scattering to discuss
profitably without rather detailed consideration.</p>

<p>The distributional facts outside Middle America thus point
to this reconstruction of events. The original Americans were
non-exogamous, non-totemic, without sibs or unilateral reckoning
of descent. The first institution of exogamic groups was on
the basis of descent in the male line, occurred in or near Middle
America, and flowed outwards, though not to the very peripheries
and remotest tracts of the continents. Somewhat later, perhaps
also in Middle America, possibly at the same center, the institution
was altered: descent became matrilinear. This new type
of organization diffused, but in its briefer history traveled less
far and remained confined to the tribes that were in most active
cultural connection with Middle America.</p>

<p>Now, however, a seeming difficulty arises. Middle America,
which appears to have evolved patrilinear and then matrilinear
clans, was itself clanless at the time of European discovery.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
The solution is that Middle America indeed evolved these institutions
and then went a step beyond by abandoning or transforming
them. Obviously this explanation will be validated in
the degree that it can be shown that probable causes or products
of the transformation existed.</p>

<h3 id="section186">186. <span class="smcap">Rise of Political Institutions: Confederacy and Empire</span></h3>

<p>In general, the transformation would seem to have been along
the line of a substitution of political for social organization.
Struggling villages confederated, with a fixed meeting place and
established council; the authority of elected or hereditary chiefs
grew, until these gave the larger part of their time to communal
affairs; towns consolidated. Public works could thus be undertaken.
Not only irrigating ditches and defenses, but pyramid
temples were constructed. In Middle America this condition
must have been attained several thousand years ago. The
Mayas had passed beyond it early in the Christian era. They
were then ruled by a governing class and priesthood, and were
erecting dated monuments that testify to a settled existence of
the more successful of their communities.</p>

<p>In the area of the United States, which may be reckoned as
perhaps two thousand years more belated than southern Mexico,
political organization was still in the incipient stage at the time
of discovery. The Pueblos of the Southwest had achieved town
life and considerable priestly control. They had not taken the
further step of welding groups of towns into larger coherent
units. In the Southeast, however, while the towns were less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
compact physically, and probably less populous, political integration
on a democratic basis had made some headway. The institution
evolved was essentially a confederacy of the members of
a language group, with civil and military chiefs, council houses,
and representation by “tribes” or towns and clans. From the
Southeast the idea of the confederacy was carried into the
Northeast by the Iroquois, whose famous league, founded perhaps
before Columbus reached America, attained its culmination
after the French and English settlement and the introduction
of firearms. The Iroquois league was an astounding
accomplishment for a culturally backward people. Its success
was due to the high degree of political integration achieved.
Yet it did not destroy the older clan system, in fact made skilful
use of it for its own purposes of political, almost imperialistic,
organization.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Some stage of this sort the Mexican peoples may have passed
through. The Maya form of political organization was evidently
similar to that of the Pueblos, the Aztec development more like
that of the Muskogeans and Iroquois. A thousand years before
Columbus the Maya cities were contending for hegemony like
the Greek city-states a millenium earlier. Then the Nahua
peoples forged to the front; and about two centuries before
the invasion of Cortez, Tenochtitlan, to-day the city of Mexico,
began a series of conquests that ended in some sort of empire.
It was a straggling domain of subjected and reconquered towns
and tribes, interspersed with others that maintained their independence,
extending from middle Mexico to Central America,
containing probably several million inhabitants paying regular
tribute, held together by well-directed military force, and governed
by a hereditary line of half-elected or confirmed rulers of
great state and considerable power. The exogamic clan organization
as such had disappeared. Groups called calpulli were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
important in Aztec society, but they were local, or based on true
kinship, and non-totemic. They may have been the made-over
survivals of clans; they were not clans like those of the Southwest,
Southeast, or Northwest.</p>

<p>Five successive stages, then, were probably gone through in
the evolution of south Mexican society. First there was the pre-clan
condition, without notable organization either social or
political; next, a patrilinear clan system; third, a matrilinear
clan system, with more important functions attaching to the
clans, especially on the side of ceremonial; fourth, the beginnings
of the state, as embodied in the confederacy, the clans
continuing but being made use of chiefly as instruments of political
machinery; fifth, the empire, loose and simple indeed,
judged by Old World standards, but nevertheless an organized
political achievement, in which the clans had disappeared or
had been transformed into units of a different nature.</p>

<h3 id="section187">187. <span class="smcap">Developments in Weaving</span></h3>

<p>In the textile arts, since the successive stages rank one another
rather obviously, and the distributions coincide well with them,
the course of development is indicated plainly.</p>

<p>The first phase was that of hand-woven basketry, which has
already been accredited to the period of immigration, and is
beyond doubt ancient. All Americans made baskets at one time
or another. The few tribes that were not making them at the
time of discovery had evidently shelved the art because their
environment provided them with birch bark, or their food habits
with buffalo rawhide, with exceptional ease, and because their
wants of receptacles and cooking utensils were of the simplest.
That basket making goes back to a rudimentary as well as early
stage of civilization is further suggested by the fact that perhaps
the finest ware is made in the distinctly backward areas,
such as the Plateau and California.</p>

<p>A second and a third phase, which are sometimes difficult to
distinguish, are those of loose suspended warps and of a simple
frame or incomplete loom. Pliable cords of some sort, or coarse
bast threads, are employed. The objects manufactured are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
chiefly wallets or bags, blankets of strips of fur or feathers,
hammocks, and the like. These two processes are widely spread,
but not quite as far as basketry; the northern and southern
extremes of the double continent do not know them. Occasionally,
very fine work is done by one or the other of these
two methods. The most striking example is the so-called Chilkat
blanket of the Northwest Coast, a cloth-like cape, woven, without
a complete loom, of mountain goat wool on cedar bark warps
to a complicated pattern—a high development of a low type
process.</p>

<p>The fourth stage is that of the true or complete loom. In
America the loom is intimately associated with the cultivation
of cotton. The two have the same distribution, except for some
use of the plant for the twining of hammocks on a half-loom in
portions of the Tropical Forest area. Disregarding this case as
a probable part adaptation of a higher culture trait to a lower
culture, we may define the distribution of both loom and cotton
as restricted to the Middle American areas, the adjacent Southwest,
and perhaps the adjacent Antilles. This is certainly
central.</p>

<p>The fifth stage is the loom with a handle or mechanical shedding
device, obviating tedious hand picking of the weft in and
out of the warps. The heddle is proved only for Peru. It was
probably used in Mexico. It may therefore be tentatively
assumed to have been known also in the intervening Chibcha
area. It is used to-day in the Southwest, but may have been
introduced there by the Spaniards. This stage accordingly is
limited even more strictly to the vicinity of Middle America.</p>

<p>The sixth stage, that of the loom whose heddles are operated
by treadles, and what may be considered a seventh, the use of
multiple heddles to work patterns mechanically, were never
attained by any American people.</p>

<p>The best and finest fabrics were made in Peru, in part probably
as consequence of the addition of wool to the previous
repertory of cotton. This addition in turn probably followed
the domestication of the llama by the Peruvians. The Mexicans
had no corresponding animal to tame, and their textiles lagged
behind in quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span></p>

<h3 id="section188">188. <span class="smcap">Progress in Spinning: Cotton</span></h3>

<p>Spinning and weaving are interdependent. Baskets are made
of woody rods, cane splints, root fibers, or straws, all untwisted,
but it is probable that the ability to twist cordage is about
equally old as basketry. At any rate there is no American
people ignorant of cord making. The materials are occasionally
sinews, more frequently bast—that is, bark fibers. These are
rolled together, almost invariably two at a time, between the
palm and the naked thigh. Cordage is used for the second
and third stages of weaving. The cotton employed in loom
weaving does not spin well by this rolling method. It was
therefore spun by being twisted between the fingers, the completed
thread being wound on a spindle. This spindle served
primarily as a spool or bobbin. In the Old World the distaff
has been used for thousands of years. This is a spindle with
a whorl or flywheel. It is dropped with a twirl, giving both
twist and tension to the loose roving of linen or wool and thus
converting it into yarn by a mechanical means. The New World
never fully utilized this device. The Southwest to-day uses the
wheeled spindle, but evidently as the result of European introduction.
Old Mexican pictures and modern Maya photographs
show the spindle stood in a bowl, not dropped. The whorl
which it possessed was therefore little more than a button to
keep the thread from slipping off the slender spindle. For Peru
this is established. Thousands of spindles have been found there,
normally with whorls too small and light to serve as an effective
flywheel. It may then be concluded that all American spinning
was essentially by hand; which is in accord with the absence
from all America of any form of the wheel. The Indian spinning
methods were only two: thigh rolling for bast, finger twisting
for cotton.</p>

<p>The origin of the higher forms of spinning and weaving in
Middle America is confirmed by the tropical origin of cotton,
on which these developments depend. The cotton of the Southwest,
for instance, was introduced from Mexico as a cultivated
plant. It is derived by some botanists from a Guatemalan wild
species. This may well have been the first variety to be cultivated
in the hemisphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span></p>

<h3 id="section189">189. <span class="smcap">Textile Clothing</span></h3>

<p>Clothing in general is too much an adaptation to climate to
render satisfactory its consideration wholly by the method here
followed. But clothing of textiles shows a distribution that is
culturally significant. The distribution is that of loom-woven
cotton; the salient characteristic is rectangular shape: the blanket
shawl, the poncho, the square shirt and skirt. In the Northwest
Coast region hand and half-loom woven capes and skirts of
bast were worn more or less. But these were flaring—trapezoidal,
not rectangular—and thus evidently represent a separate
development.</p>

<p>In all the cloth weaving areas, and in them only, sandals were
worn. The spatial correlation is so close that there must be a
connection. It may be suggested that the sandal originated, or
at least owed its spread, to textile progress. Again the Northwest
Coast corroborates by being unique; it is essentially a barefoot
area.</p>

<p>To summarize. The original textile arts of the race were
probably first advanced to the stages intermediate between basket
and cloth making in Middle America. Thence they spread
north and south, but not quite to the limits of the hemisphere,
being retained in special usage chiefly in the Northwest. With
the cultivation of cotton in Middle America, spinning and the
loom came into use, and were ultimately carried to the Southwest,
but not beyond. Cloth garments and sandals promptly
followed. The heddle was evidently devised last, and did not
diffuse beyond Middle America.</p>

<h3 id="section190">190. <span class="smcap">Cults: Shamanism</span></h3>

<p>In the matter of religious cults, seven entries have been included
in <a href="#figure35">Figure 35</a>: (1h) shamanism, and (1i) crisis ceremonies,
especially for girls at puberty and the whipping of
adolescent boys, two more or less synchronous traits; (6a) initiating
societies, and (6b) masks—also about contemporaneous;
(16) priesthood; and (22) human sacrifice and (23) temples.</p>

<p>The shaman is an individual without official authority but often
of great personal influence. His supposed power comes to him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
directly from the spirits as a gift or grant. He himself, as a
personality, has been able to enter into a special relationship,
denied to normal persons, with the supernatural world or some
member thereof. The community recognizes his power after it
is his: the community does not elect him to his special position,
nor accept him in it by inheritance. His communion with spirits
enables the shaman to foretell the future, change the weather,
blast the crops or multiply game, avert catastrophes or precipitate
them on foes; above all, to inflict and cure disease. He is
therefore the medicine-man; a word which in American ethnology
is synonymous with shaman. The terms doctor, wizard, juggler,
which have established themselves in usage in certain regions, are
also more or less appropriate: they all denote shamans. When
he wishes to kill his private or public enemy, the shaman by his
preternatural faculties injects some foreign object or destructive
substance into his victim, or abstracts his soul. To cure his
friends or clients, he extracts the disease object, sometimes by
singing, dancing, blowing, stroking, or kneading, most often by
sucking; or he finds, recaptures, and restores the soul. Of the
two concepts, that of the concrete disease object is more widely
spread; that of the soul theft is apparently characteristic of the
more advanced tribes; but the exact distribution remains to be
worked out.</p>

<p>The territorial extent of shamanistic ideas and practices is
from the Arctic to Cape Horn. The method of acquiring power
from spirits, the nature of the disease object and its process of
extraction, the conviction that sickness must be caused by malevolent
shamanistic power, there being no such thing as natural
death; these and other specific features of the institution are
sometimes surprisingly similar in North and South America. In
fact, they recur in peripheral parts of the eastern hemisphere—Siberia,
Australia, Africa—with such close resemblance as
strongly to suggest their being the remnants of a once world-wide
rudimentary form of religion or religious magic.</p>

<h3 id="section191">191. <span class="smcap">Crisis Rites and Initiations</span></h3>

<p>Crisis rites are of equally broad diffusion and apparent antiquity.
They concern the critical points of human life: birth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span>
death, sometimes marriage and childbirth; but most frequently,
or at least most sacredly, they are wont to concern themselves
with maturity. They are thus often puberty ceremonials, made
for the welfare both of the individual and of the community,
and fitting him or her for reproductive functions as well as for
a career as a useful and successful community member. The
girls’ adolescence rites have been described (§ <a href="#section154">154</a>) in some detail
for California. With but minor variations, the account there
given applies to the customs of many American and in fact Old
World peoples. The boys’ rites come at the corresponding period
of life, but their reference to sex and marriage is generally less
definite. Fortitude, manliness, understanding are the qualities
they are chiefly intended to test and fix. Privations like fasting,
ordeals of pain, admonitions by the elders, are therefore characteristic
elements of these rites. It is thus not as surprising as
it might seem at first acquaintance that identical practices, such
as having the boys stung by vicious ants, are occasionally found
in regions as remote as California and Brazil: even the particular
method may be a local survival of a wide ancient diffusion. Perhaps
most common of all specific ingredients of the rite in America
is a whipping of the boys. Possibly this commended itself as
combining a test of fortitude and an emotional memento of the
counsel imparted. At any rate it evidently became an established
part of the puberty rites thousands of years ago, and thus acquired
the added social momentum of an immemorial custom in
many parts of both North and South America.</p>

<h3 id="section192">192. <span class="smcap">Secret Societies and Masks</span></h3>

<p>Out of the puberty crisis rite for boys there grew gradually
a society of initiates who recruited their ranks by new initiations.
As emphasis shifted from the individual to the community
as represented by those already initiated, the ceremony came
to be performed less for the benefit of the individual than for the
maintenance of the group, the society as such, with its rites,
secrets, and privileges. Very often, no one was excluded but
immature boys and females; yet, if the act of admittance was
to have any psychic significance, the exclusion of these elements
of the community had to be made much of. Thus secrecy toward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
women and children was emphasized, although often the secrets
simmered down largely to the fact that there were secrets.</p>

<p>The girls’ adolescence ceremony does not seem to have taken
this course of growth, because of its more personal and bodily
character, puberty in women being so much more definite a
physiological event. There are women’s societies among some
American tribes. But they seem to be generally a weaker imitation
of the men’s societies after these were fully developed, not
a direct outgrowth of the original girls’ rite.</p>

<p>Shamanism entered as another strain into the formation of the
secret society. Medicine-men often would come to act for the
public good, the occasion would be repeated regularly, and a
communal ceremony with an esoteric nucleus resulted. Also,
the shamans at times helped the novice shamans train and consolidate
their spiritual powers. The extension of this habit perhaps
sometimes led, or contributed, to the establishment of a
secret society (§ <a href="#section158">158</a>).</p>

<p>Masks are closely associated with secret societies. They disguise
the members to the women and boys, who are told, and
often believe, that the masked personages are not human beings
at all. Of course this adds to the mystery and impressiveness
of the initiations, especially when the masks are fantastic or
terrifying. Masks and societies thus are two related aspects of
one thing. But they are by no means inseparable. There are
tribes, like some of the Eskimo, who use masks but can scarcely
be said to possess societies, while in the Plains and elsewhere
there are definite societies that initiate without masks. Physical
and economic conditions in the Arctic operating against large-scale
community life or social elaboration, the masks of the
Eskimo may represent merely that part of a mask-society
“complex” which these people could conveniently take over
when the complex reached them.</p>

<p>In the Southwest, among the Pueblos, there are two types of
societies. There is a communal society, embracing all adult
males, who are initiated at puberty by whipping and who later
wear masks to impersonate spirits and dance thus for the public
good. There are several smaller societies, also with secret rites,
which cure sickness, recruit their membership from the cured,
and use masks little or not at all. It is clear here how the two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
component strains, namely crisis rites and shamanistic practices,
have flowed into the common mold of the society idea and become
patterned by it without quite amalgamating.</p>

<h3 id="section193">193. <span class="smcap">Priesthood</span></h3>

<p>This, then, was the second general stage of American religion.
The third is marked by the development of the priesthood. The
priest is an official recognized by the community. He has duties
and powers. He may inherit, be elected, or succeed by virtue of
lineage subject to confirmation. But he steps into a specific
office which existed before him and continues after his death.
His power is the result of his induction into the office and the
knowledge and authority that go with it. He thus contrasts
sharply with the shaman—logically at least. The shaman makes
his position. Any person possessed of the necessary mediumistic
faculty, or able to convince a part of the community of his ability
to operate supernaturally, is thereby a shaman. His influence
is essentially personal. In actuality, the demarcation cannot always
be made so sharply. There are peoples whose religious
leaders are borderline shaman-priests. Yet there are other
tribes that align clearly. The Eskimo have pure shamans and
nothing like priests. The Pueblos have true priests but no real
shamans. Even the heads of their curing societies, the men
who do the doctoring for the community, are officials, and do
not go into trances or converse with spirits.</p>

<p>Obviously a priesthood is possible only in a well constructed
society. Specialization of function is presupposed. People so
unorganized as to remain in a pre-clan condition could hardly
be expected to have developed permanent officials for religion.
As a matter of fact they have not. There are not even clear
instances of a full fledged priesthood among patrilinear sib
tribes. The first indubitable priests are found among the matrilinear
Southwesterners and a few of their neighbors. Thence
they extend throughout the region of more or less accomplished
political development in Middle America. Beyond that, they
disappear.</p>

<p>Here once more, then, we encounter a trait substantially confined
to the area of intensive culture and evidently superimposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
upon the preceding stages. This makes it likely that the second
stage, that of societies and masks, originated in the same center,
but so long ago as to have been mostly obliterated by later developments,
while continuing to flourish half way to the
peripheries.</p>

<p>Even the priesthood is old in Middle America. This seems
reasonably demonstrable. We do not know its actual beginnings
there. But its surviving conditions at the edge of its area of
occurrence may be taken as roughly indicative of its origin.
Among the Pueblos, each priest, with his assistants, is the curator
of a sacred object or fetish, carefully bundled and preserved.
The fetish serves the public good, but he is its keeper. In fact
he might well be said to be priest in virtue of his custodianship
thereof. Associated is the concept of an altar, a painting which
he makes of colored earth or meal. In the Plains area, some
tribes may be somewhat hesitatingly described as having a priest
or group of old men as priests. Wherever such is the case, these
half-priests are the keepers of fetish-bundles; usually they make
something like an altar of a space of painted earth. Areas as
advanced as the Northwest Coast, where distinctive priests are
wanting, lack also the bundles and altars. It looks, therefore,
as if the American priesthood had originated in association with
these two ceremonial traits of the fetish bundle and painted
altar—both of which are conspicuously unknown in the eastern
hemisphere.</p>

<h3 id="section194">194. <span class="smcap">Temples and Sacrifice</span></h3>

<p>In Middle America the fetish bundle and picture altar do not
appear, apparently through supersedence by elements characteristic
of the next or fourth cult stage, characterized by the temple
and the stone altar used in sacrifice. Temples, however, were
already in luxuriant bloom among the Maya in their Great
Period of 400 to 600 A. D. The beginnings of their remarkable
architecture and sculpture must of course lie much farther back;
certainly toward the opening of the Christian era, very likely
earlier. Before this came the presumptive initial stage of priesthood,
with bundles and altar paintings or some local equivalent.
If a thousand years be allowed for this phase, the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
of the priesthood would fall in southern Mexico or Guatemala
at least three thousand years ago; possibly much longer. Peru,
perhaps, did not lag far behind.</p>

<p>Temples mark the last phase of native American religion, but
the most purely religious characteristic of the period, independent
of mechanical or æsthetic developments, is human sacrifice. This
had long been practised by the Mayas and in Peru, but reached
its culmination in the New World and probably on the planet,
at least as regards frequency and routine-like character, among
the Aztecs. These were a late people, by their own traditions,
to rise to culture and power, attaining to little consequence before
the fourteenth century. It looks therefore as if human
sacrifice had been a comparatively recent practice, perhaps only
one or two thousand years old when America was discovered,
and still moving toward its peak.</p>

<p>Outside Middle America, human sacrifice was virtually nonexistent.
There was considerable cannibalism in the Tropical
Forest and Antilles, but no taking of life as a purely ceremonial
act. For the Pueblos of the Southwest, there are some slight
and doubtful suggestions, but it appears that such deaths as
were inflicted were rather punishments than offerings. The one
North American people admittedly sacrificing human life were
the Pawnee, a Plains tribe, who once a year shot to death a girl
captive amid a ritual reminiscent of that of Mexico. This has
always been interpreted as suggestive of a historical connection
with Mexico. In fact, the Pawnee appear to have moved northward
rather recently, and most of their Caddoan relatives had
remained not far from the Gulf of Mexico when discovered.</p>

<p>The precise origin of sacrifice is obscure, although it is significant
that it was restricted to the area of concentrated population
and towns. In Mexico at least there were no domesticated
mammals available. The ultimate foundation of human
sacrifice is no doubt the widespread and very ancient custom
of offerings. It is, however, a long leap from the offering of a
pinch of tobacco, a strew of meal, an arrowpoint or some feathers,
or even a few bits of turquoise, to the deliberate taking of a life.
Possibly the idea of self-inflicted torture served as a connection.
The Plains tribes sometimes hacked off finger joints as offerings,
and in their Sun Dance tore skewers out of their skins. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
northern part of the Tropical Forest knotted cords were drawn
through the nose and out of the mouth—a sufficiently painful
process—in magico-religious preparation. In Mexico it was common
for worshipers to pierce their own ears or tongues, the idea
of a blood offering combining with that of penance and mortification.</p>

<p>It may seem strange that so shocking a custom as human sacrifice
represented the climax of American religious development.
Yet in a few thousand years more of undisturbed growth, it
would probably have been superseded. This is precisely what
happened in the Old World, which may be reckoned as about
four to five thousand years ahead of the New. In the Old World
also the really lowly and backward peoples did not sacrifice men.
The practice is a symptom of incipient civilization.</p>

<h3 id="section195">195. <span class="smcap">Architecture, Sculpture, Towns</span></h3>

<p>To construct stone-walled buildings seems a simple accomplishment,
especially in an environment of stratified rocks that
break into natural slabs. Such flat pieces pile up into a stable
wall of room height without mortar, and a few log beams suffice
to support a roof. Yet the greater area of the two continents
seems never to have had such structures. Stone buildings are
confined to Middle America and the Southwest. Outside these
regions only the wholly timberless divisions of the Eskimo make
huts of stone, and for their winter dwellings they are limited to
choice of this material or blocks of snow. The Eskimo hut is
tiny, not more than eight or ten feet across, and the weather is
kept out not by any skill in masonry or plastering, but by the
rude device of stuffing all crevices with sod. The Eskimo style
of “building” in stone would be inapplicable in a structure of
pretension. Made larger, the edifice would collapse.</p>

<p>The art of masonry, like agriculture, pottery, and loom weaving,
may therefore be set down as having had its origin in Mexico
or Peru, or possibly in both. It shows, however, this peculiarity
of distribution: at both ends of the area, among the Pueblos of
the Southwest in North America and among the Calchaqui of
northwest Argentina in South America, living houses were
stone-walled. In the intervening regions, most dwellings were of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
thatch or mud, public buildings of stone. The Aztec, Maya, and
Inca areas have therefore left stone temples, pyramids, palaces,
forts, and the like, but few towns; the Pueblo and Calchaqui,
only towns.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> How the Middle Americans were first brought to
use stone is not known; but a temple built as such being a more
specialized, decorative, organized edifice than a dwelling, as
well as involving some degree of communal coöperation, it can
safely be regarded as a later type than private dwellings. The
occurrence of the stone living houses at the peripheries confirms
their priority. Evidently masonry was first employed in Middle
America for simple public structures: chiefs’ tombs, water
works, platforms for worship. In its diffusion the art reached
peoples like the Pueblos, who lived in small communities, interred
their leaders without great rites, and offered no sacrifices
in sight of multitudes. These marginal nations therefore took
over the new accomplishment but applied it only to their homes.
Meanwhile, however, the central “inventors” of masonry had
grown more ambitious and were rearing ever finer and larger
structures, until the superb architecture of the Mayas and the
consummate stone fitting of the Incas reached their climax.</p>

<p>Stone sculpture grew as an accompaniment. It remained
rude in Peru, and chiefly limited to idols, in keeping with the
simple, massive style of architecture. But the Mayas covered
their structurally bolder and more diversified religious buildings
with sculpture in relief and frescoed stucco, and between
them set up great carvings of animal and mythical divinities,
as well as luxuriantly inscribed obelisks. Their sculpture is
æsthetically the finest in America and compares in quality with
that of Egypt, India, and China.</p>

<p>Recent excavations in the Southwest have revealed a succession
of stages as regards buildings. The first houses in this
region may have been thatched or earth-roofed. The earliest
in which stone was used were small, dug out a few feet, the
sides of the excavation lined with, upright rock slabs, and a
superstructure of poles or mud-filled wattling added. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span>
followed a period of detached one-room houses, with rectangular
walls of masonry; and finally the stage of drawing these together
in clusters and raising them in terraced stories. This
whole development can be traced within the area. Yet it by
no means follows that it originated wholly within the area.
The knowledge of laying stone in courses, the impulse or habit
of doing so, might, theoretically, just as well have come from
without; and evidently did actually come into the Southwest
from Mexico.</p>

<p>This is a type of situation frequently encountered in culture
history problems. A group of data seem to point to a spontaneous
origin on the spot so long as they are viewed only locally,
whereas a broader perspective at once reveals them as
merely part of a development whose ultimate source usually
lies far away. For instance, the backward Igorot tribes of the
interior Philippines rear imposing terraces for their rice plots;
their more advanced coastal neighbors do not. It has therefore
been debated whether the Igorot invented this large-scaled
terracing or learned it from the Chinese. Yet the terracing is
only an incident to rice culture, which is widespread in the
Orient, ancient, and evidently of mainland origin. The knowledge
of terracing was therefore no doubt long ago imported into
the Philippines along with rice cultivation, and the Igorot only
added the special local development of carrying the terraces to
a more impressive height. There is no question that the increase
and better concatenation of knowledge is gradually leading to
more and more certain instances of wide diffusions and fewer
and fewer cases of independent origin.</p>

<p>Town life possesses a material aspect—that of the type and
arrangement of dwellings—as well as the social and political
aspects already touched on. The largest towns in America were
those of Mexico and Peru, whose capitals may have attained
populations of fifty to a hundred thousand. The Maya towns
were smaller, in keeping with the Maya failure to develop an
empire. The largest towns of the Chibcha of Colombia may
have held ten or twenty thousand souls. The most flourishing
pueblos of the Southwest seem never to have exceeded three
thousand inhabitants. The Calchaqui towns in Andean Argentina
were no larger, probably smaller. Southeastern and Northwest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
Coast towns ran to hundreds instead of thousands of population.
These figures tell the usual story of thinning away from
center to peripheries.</p>

<p>But local differences were sometimes significant. The Southeastern
town, except for its court and rude public buildings, was
straggling and semi-rural compared with the compact, storied,
and alleyed Southwestern pueblo; often it was less populous.
Yet its political and military development was more advanced,
at any rate as a unit in the larger group of the confederacy.</p>

<h3 id="section196">196. <span class="smcap">Metallurgy</span></h3>

<p>The use of metals in America falls into three stages. The
peripheral and backward areas, such as Patagonia and California,
and those parts of the Tropical Forest in which nature
had denied a supply and remoteness had shut off trade, did
wholly without metals.</p>

<p>In the areas of medium advancement, like the Northwest,
Southwest, and the ancient Mound Builder region of the Ohio
Valley, native copper was beaten out into sheets, trimmed, bent,
gouged, and engraved. It was not smelted from ore nor cast.
Its treatment was thus essentially by stone age processes. Gold,
silver, and other metals were not used; iron only sporadically
when it could be obtained in the native metallic state from a
fallen meteorite. The supply even of copper was rarely large.
It flowed in trade, much like precious stones among ourselves,
to the wealthier groups of nations able to part with their own
products in exchange for this substance prized by them for
jewelry and insignia but rarely made into tools.</p>

<p>The third stage is that of true metallurgical processes, and is
confined to the three Middle American areas. Here, copper,
gold, silver, and so far as they were available tin and platinum,
were sought after and worked. Copper at any rate was extracted
from its ores by smelting; all the known metals were
fused and cast, both in permanent molds and by the method
of melting wax out of a single-time mold. Wire was beaten
or drawn out; gold leaf and acid plating practised; and welding,
hardening by hammering, and self-soldering were known. Alloys
were made: copper-tin bronze in Bolivia and the south<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
Peruvian highland, whence its use later spread north, perhaps
being carried as far as Mexico (§ <a href="#section108">108</a>); copper-arsenic bronze
and copper-silver alloy on the Peruvian coast; copper-gold in
Colombia and Mexico; copper-lead bronze in Mexico.</p>

<p>Nowhere, however, was metal the standard material for tools,
which continued to be mostly of stone or wood. Metallic tools
and utensils, especially knives and axes, were not altogether
rare in the bronze region of South America. The superior
hardness of bronze as compared with copper no doubt proved
a stimulus in this direction. But Maya temple-cities were built
with stone tools, and the Aztecs cut and fought with obsidian.
In general, metal remained treasure or ornament. There were
not even the beginnings of an iron culture anywhere in the
hemisphere.</p>

<p>In the larger outlines, the history of American metallurgy is
thus simple enough, as something developed late and never
diffused beyond the central region of intensive culture. As to
the sequence of use of the several metals and processes, on the
other hand, rather little has been ascertained. It seems that
in these matters South America might have been somewhat in
advance of Mexico, both in time and in degree of attainments.
The age of the metallurgical arts in Middle America must not
be underestimated. In spite of their relative recency, they can
hardly have been less than several thousand years old.</p>

<h3 id="section197">197. <span class="smcap">Calendars and Astronomy</span></h3>

<p>The earliest stage of anything like time reckoning in America
was what might be called the descriptive moon series. The return
of the seasons marked the year. Within the year, rude
track was kept of the passage of time by following a series of
“natural” months or lunations named after events, such as
“heavy cold,” “flying geese,” “deer rutting,” or “falling
leaves.” No one cared and perhaps no one knew how many
days there were in a moon, let alone in a year. No one knew his
age, nor, as a rule, how many years ago any event had taken
place. It is a mark of pretty high civilization when people know
how old they are.</p>

<p>From the point of view of accuracy, the moon series calendar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
left much to be desired, since there are something over twelve
and considerably under thirteen visible lunations in a solar or
seasonal year. Some tribes allowed twelve moons, others thirteen,
in some different individuals disagreed. Whenever the
geese actually flew, debates were settled: it was flying geese
month, and every one went on with the series from there. If
he had happened to get a moon ahead or behind, he accepted
the event as a correction.</p>

<p>The moon series calendar was used by the majority of tribes
in the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>Somewhat more advanced is the solstitial moon series. This
takes one of the solstices, usually the one just before our Christmas,
as the fixed beginning and end of the year. The days are
noticeably shortest then. Some tribes went farther and employed
landmarks to observe the place on the horizon of the
sun’s rising. Until the solstice this place shifts daily southward,
after it northward. Also, the noonday shadows fall longest
at the winter solstice. Here then was a point in the year which
was always the same, whereas the geese might fly or the leaves
fall early one year and late the next. The definiteness thus
obtained was followed up by numbering the moons instead of
describing them, or by recognizing both solstices as a frame
within which there fell two parallel groups of six moons, or of
five moons and a slightly longer solstitial period.</p>

<p>This method also did not solve the really difficult problem
of making twelve lunations and an irregular fraction fit automatically
and permanently into the solar year; and provision
for counting days and years was still wholly lacking. Yet the
first beginnings of exact astronomical observations had been
made and were utilized to give the year and its subdivisions
a certain fixity.</p>

<p>The occurrence of the simple solstitial calendar in North
America is significant. It occurs in the Southwest and Northwest:
that is, in the area most directly influenced by the higher
Mexican center, and the area which made most progress independently
of Mexico.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span></p>

<p>These two stages of the descriptive and the solstitial moon
series were long ago passed through in southern Mexico and a
need felt for a more precise time reckoning. No calendar can
either serve accuracy or cover long periods which fails to concern
itself with the exact arithmetical relation of its smaller
units to its larger ones: the number of days in the month and
year, for instance. This concern, would not be difficult if the
relations were simple; but nature has put something over 29½
days into a lunation, something under 365¼ days and a little
over 12⅓ lunations into the year. The first step ahead was
undoubtedly a day count, as previously the numbering of the
moons had marked an advance over their descriptive naming.
The day count must have revealed the discrepancy between the
actual numbers and those assumed for the larger units, such
as 30 and 360. A great advance was therefore made when the
natural lunation was wholly abandoned and artificial units substituted.
The Mayas, or possibly some previous and forgotten
people, invented a “month” of twenty days, probably because
they counted by twenties instead of tens. Eighteen of these
months, with five added leap days, made a 365-day year. Thirteen
20-day months made another and wholly arbitrary period
of 260 days, which the Aztecs, who borrowed the system, called
tonalamatl.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The tonalamatl had no basis in nature or astronomy
and was a pure invention: a reckoning device. It ran
its course concurrently with the year as two wheels of 260 and
365 cogs might engage. The same cogs would meet again at the
end of 73 and 52 revolutions respectively, that is, 365 and 260
divided by 5, their highest common factor. At the end of each
52 years, therefore, the beginning of the year and of the tonalamatl
again coincided, giving a “calendar round” of that
duration. This 52-year period is the one by which the Aztecs
dated.</p>

<p>The Mayas, however, did not content themselves with the 52-year
period, but reckoned time by katuns of 20 and cycles of
400 years.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The dates on Maya inscriptions are mostly from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
their ninth cycle, with some from the end of the eighth and beginning
of the tenth. This period corresponds approximately
to the first six centuries of the Christian era. The beginning
of the first cycle would fall more than 3,000 years before Christ.
There is no reason to believe that this time reckoning began then.
It is more likely that a little before the time of Christ the Mayas
perfected this system of chronology and gave it dignity by
imagining some seven or eight cycles to have passed between the
beginning of the world, or some other mythological event, and
the actual commencement of their record. From the close of
their eighth cycle, however, the dates are apparently contemporary
with the events to which they refer.</p>

<p>This system is so elaborate that it could scarcely have been
devised and adopted all at once. There must have been a time
lasting some centuries, perhaps over a thousand years, previous
to the Christian era, during which the first day count was being
elaborated and perfected into the classical calendar of the early
post-Christian Maya monuments.</p>

<p>This calendar did not exhaust the astronomical and mathematical
accomplishments of the Mayas. They ascertained that
eight solar years correspond almost exactly with five “years”
or apparent revolutions (584 days) of the planet Venus, and
that 65 Venus years of a total of 37,960 days coincide with two
calendar rounds of 52 solar years. They knew that their 365-day
year was a fraction of a day short of the true year, determined
the error rather exactly, and, while they did not interpolate
any leap days, they computed the necessary correction at
25 days in 104 years or two calendar rounds. This is greater
accuracy than has been attained by any calendar other than
our modern Gregorian one. As regards the moon, they brought
its revolutions into accord with their day count with an error
of only one day in 300 years. These are high attainments, and
for a people without astronomical instruments involved accurate
and protracted observations as well as calculatory ability.</p>

<p>Much less is known of South American calendars; but, like
the dwindling away from Maya to Aztec to Pueblo and finally
to the rudiments of the descriptive moon series of the backward
tribes in the northern continent, so there is discernible a retardation
of progress as the Maya focus is left behind toward the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
south. The most developed calendar in South America was that
of the Chibchan peoples of Colombia. Beyond them, the Inca,
in their greater empire, got along with a system intermediate
in its degree of development between the Aztec and the Pueblo
ones. In the Tropical Forest and Patagonian areas there do
not seem to have been more than moon name series comparable to
those of peripheral North America.</p>

<h3 id="section198">198. <span class="smcap">Writing</span></h3>

<p>Related to calendar and mathematics in its origin was writing,
which passed out of the stage of pictographs and simple ideograms
only in the Mexican area. The Aztecs used the rebus
method (§ <a href="#section130">130</a>), but chiefly for proper names, as in tribute lists
and the like. The Mayas had gone farther. Their glyphs are
highly worn down or conventionalized pictures, true symbols;
often indeed combinations of symbols. They mostly remain
illegible to us, and while they appear to contain phonetic elements,
these do not seem to be the dominant constituents. The
Maya writing thus also did not go beyond the mixed or transitional
stage. The Chibcha may have had a less advanced system
of similar type, though the fact that no remains of it have survived
argues against its having been of any considerable development.
The Peruvians did not write at all. They scarcely even
used simple pictography. Their records were wholly oral, fortified
by mnemonic devices known as quipus, series of knotted
strings. These were useful in keeping account of numbers, but
could of course not be read by any one but the knotter of the
strings: a given knot might stand equally for ten llamas, ten
men, ten war clubs, or ten jars of maize. The remainder of
South America used no quipus, and while occasional pictographs
have been found on rocks, they seem to have been less developed,
as something customary, than among the North American tribes.
All such primitive carvings or paintings were rather expressions
of emotion over some event, concrete or spiritual, intelligible to
the maker of the carving and perhaps to his friends, than records
intended to be understood by strangers or future generations.</p>

<p>Connected with the fact that the highest development of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[379]</span>
American writing took place in southern Mexico, is another: it
was only there that books were produced. These were mostly
ritualistic or astrological, and were painted on long folded strips
of maguey fiber paper or deerskin. They were probably never
numerous, and intelligible chiefly to certain priests or officials.</p>

<h3 id="section199">199. <span class="smcap">The Several Provincial Developments: Mexico</span></h3>

<p>Since the calendrical and graphic achievements enumerated,
together with temple sculpture, lie in the fields of science, knowledge,
and art, and since they show a definite localization in
southern Mexico, in fact point to an origin in the Maya area,
they almost compel the recognition of this culture center as
having constituted the peak of civilization in the New World.</p>

<p>This localization establishes at least some presumption that it
was there rather than in South America that the beginnings of
cultural progress, the emergence out of primitive uniformity,
occurred. To be sure, it is conceivable that agriculture and
other inventions grew up in Andean South America, were transported
to Mexico, for some reason gained a more rapid development
there, until, under the stimulus of this forward movement,
further discoveries were made which the more steadily and
slowly progressing Peruvian motherland of culture failed to
equal. Conjectures of this sort cannot yet be confirmed or disproved.
Civilization was sufficiently advanced in both Mexico
and Peru to render it certain that these first beginnings now
referred to, lay some thousands of years back. In the main,
Mexican and Peruvian cultures were nearly on an equality,
and in their fundamentals they were sufficiently alike, and sufficiently
different from all Old World cultures, to necessitate
the belief that they are, broadly, a common product.</p>

<p>Still, the superiority of the Mexicans in the sciences and arts
carries a certain weight. If to this superiority are added the
indications that maize and cotton were first cultivated in the
south Mexican area, in other words, that the fundamentals of
American agriculture and loom-weaving seem more likely to
have been developed there than elsewhere; and if further the
close association of pottery with agriculture throughout the
western hemisphere is borne in mind, it seems likely that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
seat of the first forward impetus out of the wholly primitive
status of American culture is to be sought in the vicinity of
southern Mexico.</p>

<h3 id="section200">200. <span class="smcap">The Andean Area</span></h3>

<p>The triumphs of Mexican civilization were in the spiritual
or intellectual field; those of Peru lay rather in practical and
material matters. The empire of the Incas was larger and much
more rigorously organized and controlled, their roads longer
and more ambitious as engineering undertakings, their masonry
more massive; their mining operations and metal working more
extensive. The domestication of the llama and the cultivation
of certain food plants such as the potato gave their culture an
added stability on the economic side.</p>

<p>The extent of the Inca empire, and of the smaller states that
no doubt preceded it, was of influence in shaping Andean culture.
Organized and directed efforts of large numbers of men
were made available to a greater degree than ever before in the
New World. The empire also operated in the direction of more
steady industry, but its close organization and routine probably
helped dwarf the higher flights of the mind. In the quality
of their fabrics, jewelry, stone fitting, and road building, as
well as in exactness of governmental administration, the Peruvians
excelled. It is remarkable how little, with all their progress
in these directions, they seem to have felt the need of advance
in knowledge or art for its own sake. They thought with
their hands rather than their heads. They practised skill and
inhibited imagination.</p>

<p>The Incas, like the Aztecs in Mexico, represent merely the
controlling nation during the last stage of development. Their
specific culture was the local one of the highlands about Cuzco.
Prehistoric remains from the coast both north and south, and in
the Andean highland southward of Cuzco in the vicinity of
Lake Titicaca and the adjacent parts of Bolivia, demonstrate
that this Inca or Cuzco culture was only the latest of several
forms of Andean culture. At the time of Inca dominion, the
great temple of Tiahuanaco near Lake Titicaca was already a
ruin. Pottery of a type characteristic of the Tiahuanaco district,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
and similar in style to its stone carvings, has been found
in remote parts of the Andean area, thus indicating the district
as an early center of diffusion. Other centers, more or less
contemporaneous, some of them perhaps still earlier, can be
distinguished along the coast. In short, the inner history of the
Andean region is by no means summed up in that picture of it
which the Inca domination at the time of discovery presented.
New scientifically conducted excavations throughout the area
will no doubt unravel further the succession of local cultural
developments.</p>

<h3 id="section201">201. <span class="smcap">Colombia</span></h3>

<p>The Chibchas of Colombia, the intermediate member of the
three-linked Middle American chain, fell somewhat, but not
very far, below the Mexicans and Peruvians in their cultural
accomplishments. Their deficiency lay in their lack of specific
developments. They do not show a single cultural element of
importance peculiar to themselves. They chewed coca, slept
in hammocks, sat on low chairs or stools; but these are traits
common to a large part of South America. Consequently the
absence or weak development of these traits in Mexico is no
indication of any superiority of the Chibchas as such. The great
bulk of Colombian culture was a substratum which underlay
the higher local developments of Mexico and Peru; and this
substratum—varied agriculture, temples, priesthood, political
organization—the Chibchas possessed without notable gaps.
Whatever elements flowed from Mexico to Peru or from Peru
to Mexico at either an early or a late period, therefore probably
passed through them. In isolated matters they may have added
their contribution. On the whole, though, their rôle must have
been that of sharers, recipients, and transmitters in the general
Middle American civilization.</p>

<h3 id="section202">202. <span class="smcap">The Tropical Forest</span></h3>

<p>The line of demarcation between the narrow Pacific slope of
South America and the broad Atlantic drainage is sharp, especially
in the region of Peru. The Cordilleran stretch is arid
along the coast, sub-arid in the mountains, unforested in all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
its most characteristic portions. East of the crest of the Andes,
on the other hand, the rainfall is heavy, often excessive, the
jungle thick, communication difficult and largely dependent on
the waterways. Even the Caucasian has made but the slightest
impression on the virgin Amazonian forest at its densest. The
Inca stretched his empire a thousand miles north and a thousand
to the south with comparative ease, establishing uniformity and
maintaining order. He did not penetrate the Tropical Forest
a hundred miles. At his borders, where the forest began, lived
tribes as wild and shy as any on earth. The Andean civilization
would have had to be profoundly modified to flourish in the
jungle, and the jungle had too little that was attractive to incite
to the endeavor. Some thousands of years more, perhaps, might
have witnessed an attempt to open up the forest and make it
accessible. Yet when one recalls how little has been done in
this direction by Caucasian civilization in four centuries, and
how superficial its exploitation for rubber and like products
has been, it is clear that such a task would have been accomplished
by the Peruvians only with the utmost slowness.</p>

<p>Yet various culture elements filtered over the Andes into the
hidden lowlands. The Pan’s pipe, for instance, an element common
to the Andes and the Forest, is likely to have originated
in the higher center. Elements like the blowgun, the hammock,
the chair or stool, are typical of the northern Forest and Antilles,
and may have infiltrated these areas from Colombia or
even been locally developed. The same is true of the cultivation
of the cassava or manioc plant, from which we draw our tapioca.
This, the great staple of the Forest region, is better adapted to
its humid climate than is maize, which flourishes best in a sub-arid
environment. Cassava may therefore be looked upon as
perhaps a local substitute for maize, evolved as a domesticated
plant under the stimulus of an already established maize agriculture.
Its cultivation has evidently spread through the Forest
region from a single source, since the specialized processes of
preparing it for food—the untreated root is poisonous—are relatively
uniform wherever it is grown. Maize is not unknown in
the area, but less used than cassava wherever the forest is dense.</p>

<p>A characteristic quality of those Forest culture-traits which
are not common ancient American inheritance, is that, whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
of Middle American or local origin, they are detached fragments,
particular devices having little or no relation to one another,
like the hammock and the blowgun, or cassava and the Pan’s
pipe. Original fundamental processes, higher accomplishments
necessitating order or organization of effort, are lacking. This
is precisely the condition which might be anticipated when a
culture too low to take over a higher one in its entirety had borrowed
from it here and there, as the Forest peoples undoubtedly
have borrowed from Middle America.</p>

<p>Three districts within the Forest area have previously been
mentioned (§ <a href="#section174">174</a>) as regions in which the forest becomes open
or disappears, and whose type of culture is locally modified:
Guiana, eastern Brazil, and the Chaco. Of these the Brazilian
highlands constitute an area of unusually deficient culture. In
parts of them agriculture and pottery seem to be lacking. These
highlands are perhaps to be construed as an interior marginal
region representing an isolation within the greater Forest area.
Had these highlands been in juxtaposition to the Andean area,
or even situated near it, they would presumably have been able
to take over Andean culture elements more successfully than the
low-lying Forest, and would then have stood out from this
through superiorities instead of absences. Their remoteness,
however, enabled the intervening Forest region to shut them off
from Andean influences of consequence, while giving to them
only part of its own low cultural content.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of the Chaco are due to the opposite reason.
The Chaco is a partly open country at the southerly extremity
of the Forest. It lies close to the foot of the Andes where these
broaden out into the southern Bolivian plateau. It also shades
off into the treeless Patagonian region. It is thus open
to influences from three sides, and its culture appears to represent
a mixture of the three adjacent ones. The basis would
seem to be the culture of the Tropical Forest, but definite Patagonian
as well as Andean elements are traceable.</p>

<h3 id="section203">203. <span class="smcap">Patagonia</span></h3>

<p>Patagonia is par excellence the peripheral region of South
America, culturally as well as geographically. As regards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
civilization, this is true in the highest degree at the extreme tip
of the continent about Tierra del Fuego. Many of the most
widely spread South American culture traits being lacking here,
there is a curious resemblance to the northerly tribes of North
America.</p>

<p>Yet even this culturally disinherited area is not without a
few local developments of relatively high order. The most striking
is the plank-built canoe of the south Chilean archipelago.
The skill to carpenter such boats was exercised in only one other
region in the hemisphere; the Santa Barbara Islands of California.
Curiously enough the latter is also a district of comparatively
backward culture. In any event this built-up canoe
of the rude people of the extreme south contrasts strikingly with
the lack of any real boats among the advanced nations in the
Andean area. The moral would seem to be that it is speculative
to base much theory or explanation on any single culture trait.</p>

<p>Of other elements specific to the Patagonian region, there
might be mentioned coiled basketry (§ <a href="#section104">104</a>) and the bolas. This
is a hunting weapon of three stones attached to ropes swung so
as to wind around the neck or legs of game. Except at the extreme
south, Patagonian culture was profoundly modified by
the introduction of the horse, which soon after the arrival of
the Spaniards multiplied on the open plains. The horse enlarged
the ability of the Patagonian tribes to take game, especially
in the Pampas in the north, increased their wealth, and
strengthened their warlike interests. The same change occurred
in the Chaco.</p>

<h3 id="section204">204. <span class="smcap">North America: the Southwest</span></h3>

<p>In North America the Southwest area lies at the point where
the continent spreads out fanwise. It is therefore the gate or
transforming station through which Mexican influences flowed
on their way to the various areas beyond. Whatever of Mexican
culture the Pueblos received and accepted, they worked over
before they passed it on. This reconstitution gave the culture a
new color. Nearly every one on first coming in contact with
Southwestern culture has been struck with its distinctive cast.
Analysis, however, shows few intrinsic elements peculiar to it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
The novelty as compared with Mexico lies in a different emphasis
or a new arrangement of the elements. Masonry, for
instance, is used for dwellings instead of temples. Town life
is well developed, but the political organization which accompanies
it in Mexico is much weaker in the Southwest.</p>

<h3 id="section205">205. <span class="smcap">The Southeast</span></h3>

<p>Superficially, Southeastern culture appears different from
Southwestern. Much of the seeming difference is due to the
wooded and rather humid environment; another portion is accounted
for by the failure of the Southeastern tribes to build
in stone. But there are differences that go deeper, such as the
poverty of Southeastern ritual and the comparative strength
of political organization. The religious dwarfing may be attributed
to greater distance from Mexico.</p>

<p>The precise routes of diffusion into the Southeast are not
wholly clear. The culture center of the area lay on or near the
lower Mississippi—sufficiently close to the Southwest. Yet the
district which is now Texas intervened, and this was one of distinctly
lower culture, largely occupied by tribes with Plains
affiliation. Theoretically it would have been possible for cultural
elements to travel from Mexico along the Texas coast to
the Southeast. Yet what little is known about the tribes of
this coast indicates that they were backward. A third possibility
for the transmission of culture was from the Antilles,
especially by the short voyage from Cuba or the Bahamas
to the point of Florida. Some connections by this route almost
certainly took place. But they seem to have affected chiefly
the peninsula of Florida, and to have brought less into the
Southeast as a whole than reached it overland.</p>

<h3 id="section206">206. <span class="smcap">The Northern Woodland</span></h3>

<p>The Northeast was historically dependent on the Southeast
as this was on the Southwest and the Southwest on Mexico. It
was thus the third stage removed from the origins in Middle
America. It was inferior to the Southeast in several points.
Pottery was cruder, clans mostly patrilinear instead of matrilinear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
town and tribal life less organized. Some exceptions
within the Northeast can be traced to direct influences or migrations
from the Southeast. The matrilinear and confederated
Iroquoian tribes of the Northeast, for instance, were linguistic
relatives of the Cherokee in the Southeast.</p>

<p>A similar movement of culture or peoples, or both, occurred
at an earlier time and has left as its remains the mounds of the
Ohio valley—local equivalents of the Mexican temple pyramid.
Some of these are of surprising bulk, and others have the form
of animals. Associated with them are earthwork fortifications
which indicate coherent populational groups of some size. The
industries of the Mound Builders were also on a somewhat
higher level, especially as regards artistic quality, than those
of the historic tribes of the region. In detail the Mound Builder
culture represents many interesting points that remain to be
cleared up. In the large, however, it was a temporary local
extension of the Southeastern culture, from which flowed its
occasional resemblances to Middle America.</p>

<h3 id="section207">207. <span class="smcap">Plains Area</span></h3>

<p>The Plains area is adjacent to the Southwest, but a review
of its culture elements shows that a surprisingly small fragment
of Southwestern civilization penetrated it. The most advanced
Plains tribes seem rather to have been in dependence on the
Southeast. This is probably to be explained as the result of
a flow of culture up the more immediate Mississippi valley. The
western Plains, close to the Rocky mountains, were sparsely
populated in aboriginal times, and life there must have been
both unsettled and narrow in its scope. Contacts between these
western Plains and the Southwest no doubt existed, but presumably
the Plains tribes were too backward, and too engrossed
in their own special adaptation to their environment, to profit
much by what they might have borrowed from the Pueblos.</p>

<p>Certain specific culture traits were developed on the Plains.
The nearly exclusive dependence on buffalo stunted the culture
in some directions, but led to the originating of other features.
Thus the Plains tribes came to live in tipis—tents made of the
skin of the buffalo—pitched these in regular order in the camp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
circle, and traveled with the bundled tents lashed to a “travois”
frame dragged by dogs. While they never accomplished anything
notable in the way of confederating themselves into larger
stable groups, nor even in effective warfare, they did develop
a system of “coup counting” or military honors which loomed
large in their life.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth century the horse was introduced
or became abundant on the Plains. It reached the Indians
from Spanish sources, as is shown by their adopting modifications
of Spanish riding gear and methods of mounting. The
horse gave them an extension of range and a greater sureness
of food supply; more leisure also resulted. The consequence
was a general upward swing of the culture, which put it, as
regards outward appearances, on a par with the cultures of
other areas that in purely aboriginal times had outranked the
Plains. This development due to the horse is in many ways
comparable to that which occurred in the Patagonian area, but
with one difference. The Patagonians possessed a meager culture.
The introduction of the horse resulted in their hybridizing
two elements so dissimilar as their own low civilization
and the Caucasian one. The Plains culture had a somewhat
fuller content. The Plains tribes were also protected from intimate
Caucasian contacts for nearly two centuries, during which
they were able to use the new and valuable acquisition of the
horse to enrich and deepen their culture without essentially
remodeling it. Horse transport was substituted for dog transport,
tipis became more commodious and comfortable, the camp
circle spread out larger, more property could be accumulated.
Warfare continued to be carried on as a species of game with
military honors as prizes, but now provided the added incentive
of substantial booty of herds easily driven off.</p>

<h3 id="section208">208. <span class="smcap">The Northwest Coast</span></h3>

<p>The North Pacific coast is the most anomalous of the North
American areas, and its history is in many ways unique. It is
nearer in miles to the Southwest and Mexico than is the Northeast,
yet agriculture and pottery never reached it. At the same
time the Northwest culture is obviously more than a marginal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
one. People with so elaborate a social organization as these
Coast tribes, and with so outstanding an art, were certainly not
peripheral dependents. The explanation is that much of the
development of culture in the Middle American region never
became established in the Northwest, but that this area manifested
a vitality and initiative of its own which led to the independent
development of a number of important culture constituents.
The art is in the main of such local origin, since it does
not affiliate closely with the art of other areas. Very important
too was the stress increasingly laid on wealth in the Northwest.
Society was stratified in terms of it. The potlatch, a combination
of feast, religious ceremony, and distribution of property,
is another peculiar outcome of the same tendency. The use of
dentalium shells as a sort of standard currency is a further manifestation.
The working of wood was carried farther than anywhere
else. Several traits, such as the solstitial calendar and
matrilinear clans, which the Northwest Coast shares with other
areas, have already been cited as probable instances of independent
evolution on the spot.</p>

<p>All in all, then, it is necessary to look upon the Northwest
Coast culture as one that fell far short of the high civilizations
of Middle America, in fact barely equaled that of the Southwest,
yet as the only one in the New World that grew to any notability
with but slight dependence on Middle America. It is an isolated
secondary peak standing aloof from the greater one that culminated
in Mexico and Peru and to which all the remainder of
the hemisphere was subordinate. <a href="#figure35">Figure 35</a> visualizes this historic
relation.</p>

<h3 id="section209">209. <span class="smcap">Northern Marginal Areas</span></h3>

<p>The Arctic, Mackenzie, Plateau, and California areas were
also but little influenced by Middle American civilization. In
fact, most of the elements which they share with it may be considered
direct survivals of the general proto-American culture
out of which the early Middle American civilization emerged.
Yet why these areas on the Pacific side of North America should
have profited so much less by the diffusion of Mexican advancement
than the areas on the Atlantic, is not clear. In the mostly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
frozen Arctic and Mackenzie tracts, the hostile environment
may have forbidden. But this explanation certainly does not
apply to the California area which lies at the very doors of the
Southwest and yet refrained from taking over such fundamentals
as agriculture and pottery. Sparseness of population cannot be
invoked as a cause, since at least along the coast the density of
population was greater than in almost all the eastern half of
the continent.</p>

<p>Of the people of these four areas, the Eskimo are the only
ones that evinced notable originality. It is easy to attribute
this quality of theirs to the stern rigor of environment. In fact,
it has been customary to appeal to the Eskimo as an example
of the popular maxim that necessity is the mother of invention.
Yet it is clear that no great weight can be attached to this simple
philosophy. It is true that without his delicately adjusted harpoon,
his skin boat, his snow hut, his dog sled, and his seal oil
lamp, the Eskimo could not have maintained an existence on
the terrifically inhospitable shores of the Arctic. But there is
nothing to show that he was forced to live in this environment.
Stretches of mountains, desert, and tundra in other parts of the
world were often left uninhabited by uncivilized peoples. Why
did not the Eskimo abandon his Arctic shore or refuse to settle
it in the first place, crowding his way instead into some more
favorable habitat? His was a sturdy stock that should have
had at least an equal chance in a competition with other peoples.</p>

<p>Furthermore it is evident that rigorous environment does not
always force development or special cultural adaptations. The
tribes of the Mackenzie-Yukon and the most northerly part of
the Northeast area lived under a climate about as harsh as that
of the Eskimo. In fact they were immediate neighbors; yet their
culture is definitely more meager. A series of the most skilled
devices of the Eskimo were wanting among them. If necessity
were truly as productive a cause of cultural progress as is
commonly thought, these Athabascan and Algonkin Indians
should have been stimulated into a mechanical ingenuity comparable
to that of the Eskimo, instead of continuing to rank
below them.</p>

<p>These considerations compel the conclusion that the Eskimo
did not develop the achievements of his culture because he lived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
in his difficult environment, but that he lived in the environment
because he possessed a culture capable of coping with it.
This does not mean that he had his culture worked out to the
last detail before he settled on the American shores of the
Arctic ocean. It does mean that he possessed the fundamentals
of the culture, and the habits of ingenuity, the mechanical and
practical turn of mind, which enabled him to carry it farther
and meet new requirements as they came up. Where and how
he acquired the fundamentals is obscure. It is well to remember
in this connection that the physical type of the Eskimo is
the most distinctive in the New World, and that his speech has
as yet shown no inclination to connect with any other American
language. It is conceivable that the origin of the Eskimo is
to be set at a time later than that of the American race and
somewhere in Asia. The fact that at present there are Eskimo
villages on the Siberian side of Behring Strait is too recent and
local a phenomenon to afford strong confirmation of such a view,
but certainly does not operate against it. Somewhere in the
Siberian region, then, within occasional reach of influences
emanating from higher centers of civilization in Asia or Europe,
the Eskimo may have laid the foundations of their culture,
specialized it further as they encountered new conditions in
new Asiatic habitats, and evolved only the finishing touches of
their remarkable adaptation after they spread along the northernmost
shores of America. Some of the Old World culture influences
which had reached them before they entered America
may go back to the Magdalenian culture of the Palæolithic.
There are at any rate certain resemblances between Magdalenian
and Eskimo cultures that have repeatedly impressed observers:
the harpoon, spear thrower, lamp, carving, and graphic art
(§ <a href="#section67">67</a>).</p>

<h3 id="section210">210. <span class="smcap">Later Asiatic Influences</span></h3>

<p>One set of influences the Eskimo, and to a lesser degree the
peoples of adjacent areas, were unquestionably subject to and
profited by: sporadic culture radiations of fairly late date from
Asia. Such influences were probably not specially important,
but they are discernible. They came probably as disjected bits<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
independent of one another. There may have been as many
that reached America and failed of acceptance as were actually
taken up. In another connection (§ <a href="#section92">92</a>) it has been pointed out
how the tale known as the “Magic Flight” has spread from its
Old World center of origin well into northwestern America.
A similar case has been made out for a material element: the
sinew-backed or composite bow (§ <a href="#section101">101</a>), first found some three to
four thousand years ago in western Asia. This is constructed,
in Asia, of a layer each of wood, sinew, and horn; in its simpler
American form, which barely extends as far south as the Mexican
frontier, of either wood or horn reinforced with sinew.
Body armor of slats, sewn or wound into a garment, seems to
have spread from Asia to the Northwest Coast. The skin boat,
represented in its most perfect type by the Eskimo kayak; the
tipi or conical tent of skins; birchbark vessels; sleds or toboggans
with dog traction; bark canoes with underhung ends; and
garments of skin tailored—cut and sewn—to follow the contours
of the body, may all prove to represent culture importations
from Asia. At any rate they are all restricted in America
to the part north and west of a line connecting the St. Lawrence
and Colorado rivers, the part of the continent that is
nearest to Asia. South and east of this line, apparently, Middle
American influences were strong enough to provide the local
groups with an adequate culture of American source; and, the
Asiatic influences being feeble on account of remoteness, Asiatic
culture traits failed of acceptance. It is also noteworthy that
all of the traits last mentioned are absent on the Northwest Coast,
in spite of its proximity to Asia. The presumable reason is
that the Northwest Coast, having worked out a relatively advanced
and satisfactory culture adaptation of its own, had nothing
to gain by taking over these elementary devices; whereas
to the culturally poorer peoples of the Arctic, Mackenzie, Plateau,
and in part of the California, Plains, and Northeastern
areas, they proved a valuable acquisition.</p>

<p>A careful analysis of Eskimo culture in comparison with north
and east Asiatic culture may reveal further instances of elements
that have spread from one hemisphere to the other. Yet
the sum total of such relatively late contributions from the
civilization of the Old World to that of the New, during the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
one or two or three or four thousand years, is not likely to
aggregate any great bulk. Since the early culture importation
of the period of the settlement of America eight or ten thousand
years ago, the influences of the Old World have always been
slight as compared with the independent developments within
the New World. Even within the northwestern segment of
North America, the bulk of culture would seem to have been
evolved on the spot. But mingled with this local growth, more
or less modifying it in the nearer regions, and reaching its
greatest strength among the Eskimo, has been a trickling series
of later Asiatic influences which it would be mistaken wholly
to overlook.</p>

<h3 id="section211">211. <span class="smcap">Sources of Knowledge</span></h3>

<p>The story of the growth and development of culture in the
Western Hemisphere which has been sketched in reconstruction
in the last chapter is built up from the incomplete information
of excavations and the indirect evidence of culture trait distributions
and analyses. Earlier than about ten thousand years
ago, this hemisphere has no known human history. In the Old
World, conditions are doubly different. There is a long primeval
record, stretching perhaps a hundred thousand years beyond
8000 B.C., documented much like the subsequent culture history
of America, but with a wealth of geological, faunal, and skeletal
data to compensate for the loss of ancient cultural evidences
in the lapse of time. Secondly, for the last ten thousand years,
there is a fuller record than for America. This greater fullness
is partly due to the earlier start toward its higher forms which
civilization took in the Eastern Hemisphere. And this relatively
early advancement brought it about that by 3000 B.C.
adequate systems of writing had been achieved in Africa and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
Asia, so that contemporary inscriptions have been preserved to
throw direct light on the thoughts and institutions of the people
of that day, and to date the centuries of their rulers for us.
These last five thousand years thus belong to history, rather
than to prehistory, in some parts of the hemisphere; and they
allow many a close inference as to what happened in the previous
five thousand years when writing was as yet unknown or
its first systems were being evolved.</p>

<p>These ten thousand years since the close of the Old Stone Age,
half of them studied by the methods of anthropology, half also
by those of history, and the whole forming the richest field in
human culture history, are the subjects of the present chapter
and the next.</p>

<p>First, however, it is necessary to refer back to the earliest
known development of civilization in the Old Stone Age (Chapter
<a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI</a>), whose close is our present starting point.</p>

<h3 id="section212">212. <span class="smcap">Chronology of the Grand Divisions of Culture History</span></h3>

<p>The period of human existence since the first tool was made
is generally divided into four grand divisions (§ <a href="#section66">66</a>, <a href="#section67">67</a>): the
Palæolithic or Old Stone Age; the Neolithic or New Stone Age;
the Bronze Age; and the Iron Age. The duration of these four
ages is diverse and notably diminishing from earliest to latest.
The last three are comprised within the past ten thousand years:
8000 B.C. may be looked upon as a reasonably accurate date for
the commencement of the Neolithic. For western Europe, at
least, the probable error of this date is not over one or at most
two thousand years. Back of this approximately fixed point
stretches the immeasurably longer Palæolithic, for the determination
of whose duration there is available not even any
semi-historical evidence, and which can only be estimated in
terms of geological alterations, continental glaciations, and
faunal and floral changes—all unsatisfactory means for arriving
at an absolute chronology expressible in years.</p>

<p>To a vague 100,000 B.C. as the tentative figure for the beginning
of the Palæolithic, and an approximate 8000 B.C. for the
commencement of the Neolithic, there can be added 3000 B.C.
for the onset of the Bronze and 1000 B.C. of the Iron Age. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
last two dates are averages only. The Greek islands, for instance,
received bronze about this period, the Orient had it
earlier, western Europe not until about 2500 B.C., northern
Europe still later. In the same way, iron is well attested for
western Asia in the thirteenth century before Christ, for Central
Europe and France about 900 B.C., in Scandinavia some
centuries later, in fact becoming abundant only shortly before
the Roman period.</p>

<p>In the wide sense, the outstanding generalizations derivable
from these figures are twofold. As regards the later periods,
those of metal and probably the Neolithic, the west lagged behind
the east, the north behind the south; Asia preceded and
invented, Europe followed and imitated. As regards the entire
duration, a tremendous disproportion is observable. The vast
bulk of the total time of culture is covered by the Palæolithic:
the three following Ages are all squeezed into a tenth of the
whole. Within this fraction again the Neolithic takes up half,
leaving the two metal Ages to divide the other half between
them. There is a clear tendency toward acceleration of development.</p>

<h3 id="section213">213. <span class="smcap">The Lower and Upper Palæolithic</span></h3>

<p>Within the Old Stone Age, a primary division is to be made
between the Lower and Upper Palæolithic. The Lower Palæolithic
comprises the Chellean, Acheulean, and Mousterian periods,
when Europe was inhabited by Neandertal man, who was
distinct from the modern human species, and possibly by a pre-Neandertal
race not yet discovered. The Upper Palæolithic, or
Reindeer Age, consists of the Aurignacian, Solutrean, and Magdalenian,
with the Azilian as epilogue. Through these Upper
Palæolithic periods long-headed branches of <i>Homo sapiens</i>—ourselves—existed:
the Cro-Magnon, Grimaldi, and Brünn types,
some of them foreshadowing the existing Caucasian and Negroid
races (§ <a href="#section14">14</a>, <a href="#section16">16-18</a>). The longest step forward in the development
of European Palæolithic civilization comes in the passage
from its Lower to its Upper phase. Before this transition, new
achievements were rare and their total small. The use of fire,
of flint cores and flakes, of fracturing and retouching, possibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
the use of wooden handles, a minimal employment of bone, and
a definite disposal of the dead, about sum up known human
attainments to the end of the Lower Palæolithic (§ <a href="#section81">81</a>).</p>

<p>Compared with this stock of culture, that of the Upper Palæolithic
is elaborate. Bone awls and weapon points; shell necklaces
and armlets; clothing; painting of the dead; sculpture and
engraving—a greater number of elements than the Lower Palæolithic
had been able to accumulate in perhaps 75,000 years—appear
in the Aurignacian. The foundations of the whole of
the Upper Palæolithic civilization were laid in this period. That
the Solutrean added needles and surface retouching of flint, the
Magdalenian a more vigorous development of pictorial line and
use of colors, lamps, harpoons, and spear throwers, represented
in the main only an enriching of the general Upper Palæolithic
culture, whose essentials were determined at the outset.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<h3 id="section214">214. <span class="smcap">Race Influence and Regional Differentiation in the Lower Palæolithic</span></h3>

<p>This profound change raises a natural conjecture. The Lower
Palæolithic culture, at least in its latest form, was carried by
Neandertal man; Upper Palæolithic culture is in great part
associated with Cro-Magnon man, whose anatomy was nearer
our own. Did not this relatively modern structure involve also
a relatively modern set of mental faculties, and these in turn,
by their own sheer worth, produce the richer culture? The supposition
is plausible enough, and has been made. But it is
sounder procedure to withhold commitment of opinion. The
inference involves the assumption that approach to our own
bodily type is accompanied by higher native intelligence; and
the further assumption that higher intelligence will automatically
produce advance in civilization. Probable as both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
these assumptions may seem, they are still undemonstrated, in
general and in particular. The application of the assumptions
to the facts therefore gives an apparent explanation in terms
of an ultimate but really unknown causality. By accepting this
hypothetical causality, it turns attention away from the question
of its validity. But the validity of the causal relation
between the body and intelligence, and between intelligence and
culture, is precisely a point that needs elucidation. It needs
elucidation as much as does the change of civilization that occurred
in Europe about 25,000 years ago; and is a much broader
problem—indeed, part of the most fundamental problem that
anthropology still faces as unsolved. Instead of a snapping
interpretation of a dubious point in human history in terms of
a couple of still more dubious principles, it will be wiser to lay
these principles aside, for a time at least, and to reconsider more
intensively the facts bearing on the particular point at issue.</p>

<p>There are two obvious lines of evidence that may help to throw
light on the change from the Lower to the Upper Palæolithic,
and in fact aid understanding of the whole Palæolithic. The
first comprises the relations between western Europe and other
areas during that period; the second, regional differences within
Europe. In the previous chapter on the Palæolithic, such considerations
have been disregarded in favor of a schematic presentation
of what seemed the salient facts in a field made sufficiently
difficult by the antiquity and incompleteness of data.
The best of these data, and those which arrange themselves most
systematically, are those from Europe, which have therefore been
presented as if they constituted a self-sufficient unit. But it is
unlikely that the culture should have developed in Europe in
complete detachment for a hundred thousand years or that it
should have remained identical over the whole of that continent.
It is necessary, in short, to revise the simple outline of Chapter
<a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI</a> by giving heed to geographical and other disturbing considerations.</p>

<p>First of all, it is well to realize that what has heretofore been
called the first tool, the Chellean pick or coup-de-poing, was not
so much the only tool of its period as the most characteristic
one. It seems to have been accompanied at all times and everywhere
by smaller, less regularly made implements, some of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span>
were even worked out of flakes instead of cores and subjected
to crude blow-retouching. Further, these medium-sized pieces
were probably “invented” before the coup-de-poing; which is
after all what might be expected, the coup-de-poing being a comparatively
effective, regularly shaped, symmetrical implement
involving both an ideal of form and a tolerable, rough skill to
produce. Several Pre-Chellean stations, containing such smaller
implements but no coups-de-poing, are now recognized by many
specialists in prehistory. The most notable are those of St.
Acheul and Abbeville, in northern France; the remainder are
in the same part of that country, in Belgium, or in southern
England, which at that time formed part of the continent. The
fauna of some of these sites is an early one and has been
attributed to the second interglacial era (§ <a href="#section69">69</a>) as compared
with the third interglacial in which the Chellean and Acheulean
fall.</p>

<p>When the Chellean proper, with its typical, well-developed
picks, is examined, it becomes clear that the distribution of this
distinctive form is limited to a narrow strip of westernmost
Europe from Belgium to Spain. The picks recur in north and
east Africa and the districts of Asia bordering on the Mediterranean.
They may not be of exactly the same age in these
regions as in westerly Europe, but they are of the same type,
and in view of the continuity of their distribution must be historically
connected. In fact, the coup-de-poing Chellean might
well be described as essentially an African (or Africo-Asian)
development which underwent an extension across what was
then the land-bridge of Gibraltar up the Atlantic face of Europe
(<a href="#figure37">Fig. 37</a>).</p>

<p>The remainder of Europe was evidently also inhabited in this
era; but by people of a variant culture. From Germany eastward
into Russia, possibly Siberia, implements were worked
which in part suggest the Pre-Chellean ones of northern France,
in part developments of such Pre-Chellean pieces, and in part
forms approaching Mousterian types. They do not include
Chellean picks. The name Pre-Mousterian has been proposed
for this central and east European culture. This name is appropriate,
provided it is remembered that Pre-Mousterian denotes
not a phase intermediate between the Acheulean and Mousterian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
of western Europe, but a culture developed, like the
Chellean, yet more or less independently, out of the Pre-Chellean,
and approximately coeval with the pure Chellean of
western Europe and its Acheulean continuation. In other
words, two culture-areas, an African-west-European and an east<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
European, begin to be discernible from an extremely early time
in the Lower Palæolithic (<a href="#figure37">Fig. 37</a>).</p>

</figure>

<p>During the Acheulean, the western culture spread somewhat:
into southern England, southeastern France, Italy, and began
to overlap with the eastern culture along the Rhine. In the
Mousterian, an assimilation seems to have taken place: culture,
or at least flint industry, became more uniform over the whole
of Europe, and in a measure the near parts of Asia and Africa
also. This general Mousterian culture, with its small implements
and emphasis on retouching, seems more likely to have
evolved out of the pickless eastern Pre-Mousterian than out of
the western Chellean-Acheulean with its large hewn coups-de-poing.</p>

<p>This would suggest an eastern origin for Mousterian man—the
Neandertal race. But it is well not to proceed beyond some
slight probability on this point because it is by no means certain
that culture traveled only as races traveled. In their
simple way, culture contacts without migrations may have been
substantially as effective in shaping or altering civilization fifty
thousand years ago as to-day. For all that can be demonstrated
at present, the Mousterian Neandertal men of western Europe
may have been the blood descendants of the undiscovered
Chellean-Acheulean inhabitants of western Europe who had
learned more effective retouching and smaller tools from the
east Europeans.</p>

<h3 id="section215">215. <span class="smcap">Upper Palæolithic Culture Growths and Races</span></h3>

<p>With the advent of the Upper Palæolithic, possibly some
25,000 years ago, the divergent culture-areas of the early Lower
Palæolithic which had become largely effaced during the Mousterian,
emerge again; but with shifted boundaries. The line of
demarcation now is no longer formed by the Rhine and the
Alps, but by the Pyrenees. Throughout the Upper Palæolithic,
most of Spain formed an annex to the North African province,
whose culture has been named the Capsian after the type station
of Gafsa in Algiers. The Aurignacian, Solutrean, and Magdalenian
as they have been previously described (§ <a href="#section72">72-81</a>) ran
their course in a middle European belt stretching from France<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
to Poland (Figs. <a href="#figure38">38</a>, <a href="#figure39">39</a>). Northern Spain, southern England,
at times Italy and southern Russia, were more or less in this
mid-European province. The Balkans remain insufficiently explored;
all northernmost Europe was still uninhabited. In
general, it may be said that the mid-European Upper Palæolithic
culture is characterized by the associated traits of work
in bone and art; the contemporary Spanish-African Capsian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
by specialization along the line of increasingly smaller and finer
flint implements, culminating in neat microliths measurable only
in fractions of inches.</p>

<p>The southern equivalent of the mid-European Aurignacian
was the Lower Capsian, of at least equal territorial extent even
in its narrowest form (<a href="#figure38">Fig. 38</a>). The industry of Syria at this
period was allied to the Capsian of Africa and may be regarded
as related to it. The rather scant remains of the age in Italy
are perhaps also to be allied with the Capsian culture rather
than with the true Aurignacian. This makes it look as if at this
time a great Lower Capsian culture-area embraced nearly all
the shores of the Mediterranean. As against this, the mid-European
true Aurignacian, so far as now known, covered only
a narrow region.</p>

<p>During the Solutrean and Magdalenian, Africa and Spain
were in the Upper Capsian. Evidence from the eastern Mediterranean
begins to fail. Italy is wholly without discovered
remains. There are indications (§ <a href="#section240">240</a>) that at least by the
beginning of the Magdalenian in Europe, the favored land of
Egypt had already entered into the Neolithic. If this is so,
westernmost Asia, Greece, and even Italy may have begun to
be affected by this higher phase of culture, and the paucity
or absence of their late Palæolithic remains would be accounted
for. This view seems reasonable, but is unproved.</p>

<p>The Solutrean seems to have been a brief period in western
Europe, and its extent appears limited also (<a href="#figure39">Fig. 39</a>). It reveals
two principal areas: one north of the Danube, the other in
southern France. The former may have been the earlier, from
which the culture, or certain phases of it, such as the art of
even surface retouch on leaf-shaped blades, were carried westward
into France. In this connection two facts may be significant.</p>

<p>First is the circumstance that the north Danubian Solutrean
area possessed an art, apparently largely of Solutrean age,
which is quite different from the Upper Palæolithic art of the
west. Naturalism was scarcely attempted, figures were highly
conventional, the style was one of concentric curves or stippling
or hatching.</p>

</figure>

<p>The second consideration is the Brünn race. This type, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
as yet is known only from a few examples (§ <a href="#section17">17</a>), is generally
considered Neandertaloid, but also shows leanings toward the
Cro-Magnon race as well as differences from it. The less dubious
Brünn remains, those from Brünn, Brüx, and perhaps Predmost,
are all from Czecho-Slovakia, that is, the north Danubian
region; and they seem to be of Solutrean age. These facts render
it likely that there existed a connection between the east<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
Solutrean culture, the geometric art, and the Brünn race, and
they indicate at least some probability of the spread of Solutrean
culture from eastern to western Europe. Brünn man may have
been a modified Neandertal man who persisted in the east after
Cro-Magnon man had become established in the west during
the Aurignacian. Or he may have been a local eastern variant
of a generic type whose better known western form we call Cro-Magnon
man.</p>

<p>As to Grimaldi man, his Negroid affiliations also seem less
startling once it is clear that the Aurignacian civilization was
a mid-European phenomenon, and that contemporary Spain
and probably Italy formed part of the essentially African development
of the Lower Capsian. With southern Europe a cultural
annex of north Africa at this period, the presence there
of a Negroid type is reasonable enough. Further, both the
strait of Gibraltar and that between Tunis and Sicily were land
bridges during part of the Pleistocene; Gibraltar, for instance,
probably during the Lower Capsian and, again, after a subsidence,
in the Upper Capsian. The Mediterranean, in other
words, must be conceived not as a great barring sea, but as a
land-locked lake or pair of lakes, so that Europe and Africa
were joined geographically as well as racially and culturally.</p>

<p>As to the Cro-Magnon race, its association with the Aurignacian-Magdalenian
culture of mid-European type is clear enough,
but its origin remains problematical. One naturally looks eastward:
to the north lay ice, to the west the Atlantic, to the south
a different even though related culture. But nothing is really
known; no ancestral Asiatic form, no closely cognate later race,
no eastern culture out of which the Aurignacian might have
sprung nor to which it might have been specifically related.
All or some of these may have existed, but in the absence of
discovery, speculation is of little profit. There is the further
difficulty about a theory that brings Cro-Magnon man out of
the east into the west of Europe, that a little later, in the
Solutrean, central Europe, through which he presumably passed,
seems to have been in possession of the Brünn race. True, this
might have been a later wave out of the east; but to derive both
races out of Asia, and perhaps the preceding Neandertal type<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
also, is a bit monotonous as a hypothesis, besides being one of
those assumptions that seem to answer problems without really
helping their understanding.</p>

<p>Much the same may be said as to the fate of Neandertal man—whether
he was exterminated by the Cro-Magnons, or absorbed,
or was driven away, or died out. A single discovery on this
point will be worth more than the most elaborate conjecture.</p>

<p>Two points seem clear, whatever may have been the diffusions
of race and culture at the time that the Lower Palæolithic was
being replaced by the Upper. On the side of flint industry,
there was no break: the Aurignacian is the continuation of the
Mousterian. The experts occasionally have difficulty in agreeing
whether a station or level is to be assigned to the late Mousterian
or early Aurignacian. Whatever, therefore, was imported
in the Upper Palæolithic was joined to something that remained
over and continued in middle Europe from the Lower Palæolithic.
Secondly, the center of known naturalistic art development
was the west, southern France especially; perceptibly in
the Aurignacian, notably in the Magdalenian. Yet this tract
is peripheral to the Aurignacian-Magdalenian culture as a
whole. It would thus be a forced explanation to look upon this
art as the outright result of a diffusion or migration: the supposed
recipients of the accomplishment would be carrying it
farther than its originators. In other words, Upper Palæolithic
art was in the main a growth on the soil of western Europe, so
far as present evidence indicates. These findings diminish the
probability of any large scale importation of Upper Palæolithic
culture ready made as a by-product of the irruption of a new
race. The change from Lower to Upper Palæolithic was indeed
profoundly significant. But much of it may have been consummated
by a gradual evolution within western and central
Europe.</p>

<p>It is worth observing that the Lower Palæolithic of Europe
with all its fundamental unity of culture stretched through
different climates. The Chellean was at least in part sub-tropical,
the Acheulean a time of cooling steppe climate, the
Mousterian the period of maximum glaciation. The Upper
Palæolithic again has its transition from the close of the Würm
glaciation to the present temperature of Europe broken by three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
temporary advances of the ice, known as they occurred in the
Alps as the Bühl, Gschnitz, and Daun phases. The following
correlation of climatic and cultural periods has been suggested:
Aurignacian, close of the last glacial and beginning of the
post-glacial; Solutrean, first maximum of ice recession (<i>Achenschwankung</i>);
Magdalenian, Bühl advance, second recession,
and Gschnitz advance, corresponding respectively to the early,
middle, and late stages of the period. To these might be added
that the Azilian came at about the third recession and brief
final Daun advance; the Neolithic, with the final recession of
ice and appearance of modern conditions. It is clear that climatic
circumstances were not the chief determining factor in
the cultural development of early Europe. Had they been such,
the Chellean would have differed culturally more from the
Mousterian than this from the Aurignacian.</p>

<p>Southern Europe and North Africa were not glaciated in the
Pleistocene. Heavier rainfall, perhaps accompanied by forestation,
are likely to have taken the place of the ice, whereas
a change from forest to steppe, or steppe to desert, corresponded
to the recession of the ice in Alpine and northern Europe. For
more distant regions, such as India and south Africa, the climatic
correlations with Europe become dubious; which is one of
the reasons why as yet no sure linking in time can be effected
between their Palæolithic culture and that of Europe.</p>

<h3 id="section216">216. <span class="smcap">The Palæolithic Aftermath: Azilian</span></h3>

<p>After the Magdalenian, there follows in western Europe the
Azilian, or Azylian, named after Mas d’Azil in the French
Pyrenees. It has also been called Tourassian. This was the
period in which the reindeer died out, being replaced by the
deer. Harpoons were accordingly made of deer horn instead
of reindeer antler, the spongier texture of the interior of the
material necessitating a coarser and broader form. Perforations
to hold the harpoon line now began to be regularly provided.
Bone implements were fewer, chiefly awls or simple dart
heads. Stone implements became less important. The best made
flint forms were minute points or blades of geometric form, often
trapezoidal. These are the microliths, obviously intended, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
main, for insertion in wood, sometimes perhaps in sawlike rows.
The great naturalistic Magdalenian art was dead in the Azilian.
Its place was taken by simple conventional designs painted on
pebbles, sometimes curiously suggestive of alphabetic symbols,
although it is unthinkable that they could at this early time,
and among so backward a people as these deer hunters, have
served any purpose of writing. The puzzling designs are more
likely to have been used in magic or religion.</p>

<p>The period of the Azilian was perhaps 10,000-8000 B.C. The
climate was approaching that of to-day, though still cooler. The
area of the Azilian proper was limited to the Pyrenean environs
of southern France and northern Spain. Related and contemporary
cultures can however be traced much farther; and the
name Azilian in a larger sense may justifiably be applied to
these also. The greater part of Spain and Portugal and north
Africa were at this time in the Terminal Capsian. This was a
local phase lacking the deer horn harpoons and painted pebbles
of the Pyrenees, but with the microlithic flint industry especially
conspicuous. In fact it is in Africa that the development
of the extreme microlithic forms out of their antecedents, the
reduced implements of the Upper Capsian, has been most clearly
traced. In Europe the Azilian forms do not connect nearly so
closely with the preceding Magdalenian. It looks therefore as
if the culture of western Europe in this period were based to
a considerable extent on traits evolved in Africa, to which
various additions were made locally, like the pebble-painting
in the Pyrenean area. This preponderance of African influences
is corroborated by the occurrence in Syria and southern
Italy of small flints allied to the Terminal Capsian ones. The
same may be said of a culture phase of northern France, the
Tardenoisian, which extended also to Belgium and England—which
latter seems not to have become finally separated from the
continent until about this era. The Tardenoisian is specifically
characterized by microliths almost indistinguishable from the
north African ones, but lacks the other traits of the south French
Azilian. It may also have persisted longer, into the period
which in the south was already early Neolithic. Approximately
contemporary and related is also the south German culture represented
at Ofnet, famous for its nests of skulls from decapitated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
bodies; and that in southern Scandinavia called Maglemose
(§ <a href="#section233">233</a>). In Scotland and northern England, on the other hand,
the harpoon head is once more to the fore, perhaps because here
as in the Pyrenean area forested mountains and the sea were
in juxtaposition and deer and salmon could both be taken abundantly.
The food habits of sub-arid and arid north Africa must
have been quite different; in fact it is evident that snails were
seasonally consumed here in large quantities.</p>

<p>All these local phases interrelate and may be grouped together
as Azilian as designative of the period and generic culture.
The map (<a href="#figure40">Fig. 40</a>) shows the extent to which the manifestations
of this culture stage have been traced. They may prove
to extend farther.</p>

<p>Spain, at the close of the Palæolithic, possessed art of three
types. In the north, Magdalenian realism flourished as vigorously
as in neighboring southern France. The paintings of the
cave of Altamira, for instance, are no less numerous and superb
than those of Font-de-Gaume. Second, in the south, there prevailed
a conventional style. Men and animals are still recognizable,
but schematically drawn, and among them are pictographic
symbols. Third, in eastern Spain, a cliff art was realistic
in purpose, but crude in execution. One can see without difficulty
what the figures are doing, but the proportions are distorted,
and the fresh, vivid, sure spirit of Magdalenian painting
is wholly lacking. The figures represent people more often than
animals: gatherings, dances, long-gowned women, men with
bows. This is the earliest direct or indirect record of the bow
and arrow. It dates from the final phase of the Palæolithic, and
the weapon may not have become employed throughout Europe
until the Neolithic was definitely under way.</p>

<p>It is well to remember in this connection that no specific type
of culture, no matter how old, is likely ever to have existed
without variation over a whole hemisphere or continent. The
later any type is, the greater is the probability that it has had
sufficient time for specific characterization to enable it to be
distinguished readily from the contemporary cultures of other
areas. The local provinces or culture-areas of the Palæolithic
foreshadow the deeper regional differentiations of the Neolithic,
Bronze, and Iron Ages.</p>

<p>There is some variation of usage as to whether the Azilian
is assignable to the Palæolithic or Neolithic. Some include it
with the earliest Neolithic phases to constitute a Mesolithic or
Middle Stone Age. The era has also been designated Epi-Palæolithic
and Proto-Neolithic. The concept of a separate
Mesolithic period becomes important in the degree that the
original definition of the Neolithic as limited to the age of
polished stone remains rigorously adhered to. With the Neolithic
conceived more broadly, as discussed in the following section,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
a separate Mesolithic becomes unnecessary, and the Azilian
takes its place as a final Palæolithic episode of mixed African
and local developments after the passing of the characteristic
European Upper Palæolithic.</p>

<h3 id="section217">217. <span class="smcap">The Neolithic: Its Early Phase</span></h3>

<p>The Neolithic is by original definition the age of polished
stone as opposed to the fracturing of stone in the Palæolithic.
In a sense, this definition is a true one, at any rate for Europe
and the Near East. There is no stone grinding in the Palæolithic
and there is in the Neolithic. But since the two stone
ages were first discriminated fifty or more years ago, a vast body
of knowledge has accumulated about them, with the result that
the original criterion has become only an approximate one. The
definition of the Neolithic as the age of ground stone is at the
present time so over-elementary as to have become inaccurate.
A long initial phase of this age did not yet grind stone, but continued
to use tools made by the Palæolithic process of chipping.
It was not until the latter part of the New Stone Age was
reached, what we may call the Full Neolithic, that the grinding
and polishing of stone were attempted.</p>

<p>What, then, it is natural to ask, makes the Early Neolithic
Age really Neolithic—what in fact separates it from the Palæolithic?
It is a cluster of traits; a cluster that grew as the Neolithic
progressed; but every one of whose constituents was lacking
from the Old Stone Age.</p>

<h3 id="section218">218. <span class="smcap">Pottery and the Bow</span></h3>

<p>Outstanding in this cluster of cultural traits that mark the
Neolithic is pottery. Wherever, in Europe and the Near East at
least, there is universal agreement that a stage of development
was Neolithic, pottery is present. And conversely, wherever
pottery occurs, no one has yet doubted that a true Neolithic
stage existed. The earliest potteryless phases, such as that of
Maglemose, which have sometimes been designated as Proto-Neolithic,
sometimes as Mesolithic, can advantageously be considered
terminal Palæolithic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span></p>

<p>Second in importance is the bow, which in general appeared
contemporaneously with pottery. The evidence for its existence
is sometimes less clear. Pottery is imperishable and unmistakable.
The bow and arrow, on the other hand, are made of materials
that decay in a few years, under ordinary conditions. Only
the stone or bone point preserves, and this cannot always be
distinguished with positiveness from the head of a light spear
or even from a small knife blade. There was a time, for instance,
when the smaller flint blades of the Solutrean were often
regarded as arrow points, whereas now the tendency, based on
more intensive comparisons, is to deny the bow and arrow to the
Magdalenian as well as the Solutrean. Certainly the harpoon
and its thrower are so numerous and indubitable in the Magdalenian
that there would be reason to expect an important
weapon like the bow to have left at least some sure traces: a
definitive type of recognizable arrow head would have been
worked out. But such is not the case.</p>

<p>These two culture elements, pottery and the bow, signalized
an enormous advance over the past. Both required definite
technical skill to manufacture. And both were of the greatest
service. Whole lines of foods could now be utilized that had
formerly been passed by: soups, stews, porridges. Plants whose
seeds or parts before were inedible, or almost so, were added to
the diet as soon as they could be boiled. The bow made possible
long range fighting, the free pursuit of large game, and the
capture of many small mammals and birds which previously it
must have been difficult to take. The harpoon was developed
chiefly for fishing. It would be of little help in killing birds,
rabbits, and the like, or large and dangerous animals like wild
cattle.</p>

<h3 id="section219">219. <span class="smcap">Bone Tools</span></h3>

<p>Hand in hand with the invention or rather introduction of
the bow and pottery—it seems doubtful whether they were devised
in Europe—went an increased employment of bone and
horn tools at the expense of stone. This drift had already begun
in the Upper Palæolithic; in fact, is one of the signs that mark
it off from the Lower Palæolithic. It became accentuated as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
the Upper Palæolithic wore on, still more prominent in its
closing Azilian phase<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>—hence the increasing minuteness of
flint blades—and continued into the early Neolithic. A good
working chisel, wedge, awl, or needle, for instance, must be
smooth. This finish is difficult in chipped stone, but easily
attained in bone or horn by rubbing. It was not therefore until
stone grinding came into use in the later Neolithic, that bone
and horn began to fall in significance as materials. But they
had performed their service. It is unlikely that stone polishing
would have been attempted but for the experience and long
habits of the polishing process as acquired in dealing with the
softer materials.</p>

<h3 id="section220">220. <span class="smcap">The Dog</span></h3>

<p>The first animal was also domesticated about the beginning
of the Neolithic. Dog remains have been found in two very late
post-Magdalenian Palæolithic sites, one in Scotland, the other
in Denmark, both apparently Azilian in age. Then, the Danish
kitchenmiddens, which began in the first stage of the Early
Neolithic, contain innumerable bones that have been gnawed
by dogs. The animals may still have been half wild at this
period, since their own skeletons are rare in the middens. Evidently
the species was not yet firmly attached to man; its members
went off to die in solitude. This is what has generally
been predicated on hypothetical grounds of the history of dog
and man. Contrary to most domesticated animals, the dog is
thought not to have been captured and tamed outright, but to
have attached himself to human beings as a parasitic hanger-on,
a shy, tolerated, uncared-for scavenger, living in a stage of symbiotic
relationship with our ancestors before his real domestication.
This view the prehistoric evidence seems to confirm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span></p>

<h3 id="section221">221. <span class="smcap">The Hewn Ax</span></h3>

<p>One more trait signalizes the Early Neolithic: the hewn stone
ax. This was a chipped implement, straight or slightly convex
along the cutting edge, tapering from that to the butt, about
twice as long as broad, rather thick, unperforated and ungrooved;
in fact perhaps often unhandled and driven by blows
upon the butt: a sharp stone wedge as much as an ax, in short.
The whole Palæolithic shows no such implement: even the
Azilian has only bone or horn “axes.”</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to repeat for the Neolithic what has
already been said of the Palæolithic periods: the older types,
such as chipped flint tools, continued very generally to be made.
Such persistence is natural: a survival of a low type among
higher ones does not mean much. It is the appearance of new
and superior inventions that counts.</p>

<p>The Early Neolithic can be summed up, then, in these five
traits: pottery; the bow and arrow; abundant use of bone and
horn; the dog; and the hewn ax.</p>

<h3 id="section222">222. <span class="smcap">The Full Neolithic</span></h3>

<p>It is the later or Full Neolithic, beginning probably between
6000 and 5000 B.C. in western Europe, that is marked by the
grinding or polishing of stone. Even this criterion is less deep-going
than might be thought from all the references that prehistorians
have made to it, since the new process was put to
limited service. Practically the only stone implements that were
ground into shape in Europe were of the ax class: the ax head
itself, the celt or chisel, hammer stones, and clubheads. The
mill is the principal artifact that can be added to the list. The
ax long remained what we to-day should scarcely dignify with
the name of ax head: an unpierced, ungrooved blade. It is only
toward the end of the Neolithic in Europe, after metal was
already in use in the Orient and Mediterranean countries, that
perforated and well ground stone axes appear; many of these
make the impression of being stone imitations, among a remote,
backward people, of forms cast in bronze by the richer and more
advanced nations of the South and East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span></p>

<p>Much more important than the ground stone ax in its influence
on life was the commencement, during the Neolithic, of two of
the great fundamentals of our own modern civilization: agriculture
and domestic animals. These freed men from the buffetings
of nature; made possible permanent habitation, the accumulation
of food and wealth, and a heavier growth of population.
Also, agriculture and animal breeding were evidently introduced
only after numbers had reached a certain density. A sparse
population, being able to subsist on wild products, tends to remain
content with them. A fertile area with mild winters may
support as high as one soul per square mile without improvement
of the natural resources; in large forests, steppes, cold
climates, and arid tracts, the territory needed for the subsistence
of each head becomes larger in a hunting stage of existence.</p>

<p>The cultivated food plants of the European Neolithic were
barley, wheat, and millet, pease, lentils, and somewhat later,
beans and apples. All of these seem to derive from Mediterranean
or west Asiatic sources. Of non-edible plants there was
flax, which served textile purposes and involved loom weaving.</p>

<p>The species of domesticated animals numbered four, besides
the dog: cattle, swine, sheep, and goats. The horse,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> cat, hen,
duck, came into Europe during the metal ages, in part during
the historic period.</p>

<h3 id="section223">223. <span class="smcap">Origin of Domesticated Animals and Plants</span></h3>

<p>The place of first domestication of the four oldest species is
not known surely. Most of them had wild representatives in
Europe long before and after the domesticated forms appear,
but the same was true in western Asia and Egypt, and the general
priority of these tracts in metal working and other cultural
achievements makes it likely that their inhabitants were also
the first to tame the animals in question. The subject is as
intricate as it is interesting, because of difficulty which biologists
experience in tracing the modified tame forms back to the
wild species with certainty. The mere fact of continued domestication,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
even without conscious selection in breeding, often alters
a species more from what may have been its old wild form than
this differs from another wild species.</p>

<p>It is however clear from the unusually abundant and well
preserved Lake-dwelling remains of Switzerland that the earliest
known domestic animals of this region were considerably different
from the nearest native species. The wild bull or urus
of Europe, <i>Bos primigenius</i>, was large and long-horned. His
bones in the oldest lake dwellings seem to come from wild individuals
that had been hunted. Alongside are the remains of the
domesticated <i>Bos brachyceros</i>, a short-horned form, small and
delicately built. Later, though still in the Neolithic, long-horned
tame cattle appear in the lake dwellings. Apparently the short-horns
had first been imported from the south; then the native
urus was tamed; finally, the two strains were crossed. These
strains are thought to survive in our modern cattle, those of
eastern and central Europe being prevailingly of the <i>primigenius</i>,
of western Europe of the <i>brachyceros</i> type.</p>

<p>A similar story applies to the pig. The first domesticated
swine of Switzerland were small, long-legged, and easily distinguishable
from the wild boar of the region. It thus is likely
that they were imported domesticated. In the Bronze Age,
pigs grew larger, due perhaps to crossing with the wild species.
Sheep were certainly brought into Europe, as there is no corresponding
wild form; the goats, too, have their nearest relatives
in Asia. They were perhaps tamed before sheep. At any
rate, goats prevailed in the earlier lake dwellings, whereas later,
sheep outnumbered them.</p>

<p>Similar arguments apply to the origin of the cultivated plants
in Europe. For some of these, such as wheat, wild relatives—possible
ancestors—are known from Asia, but not from Europe.
Also there has been such a drift of later cultivated plants—legumes,
greens, and fruits—from Asia and the Mediterranean
into Europe during the Bronze and Iron Ages, as to render it
probable that the earliest flow was in the same direction. The
instances of diffusion from north to south are few: oats, rye, and
hemp are perhaps the principal. These plants, however, were
carried southward slowly and accepted reluctantly, whereas the
northerners were in general avid of any southern or Oriental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
form which would bear their climate, as the progressive spread
and increased use of new forms shows. Furthermore, even oats,
rye, and hemp appear to be Asiatic in origin, and thus to have
entered Europe merely from the east, instead of southeast.</p>

<h3 id="section224">224. <span class="smcap">Other Traits of the Full Neolithic</span></h3>

<p>The earliest animals were kept for their flesh and hides. Two
or three thousand years passed before cattle were used before
the plow or to draw wagons. Both the plow and the wheel were
unknown in Europe until well in the Bronze Age, after they
had been established for some time in Asia. Still later was the
use of milk. Here again Asia and Egypt have precedence.</p>

<p>Many other elements of culture appear in the Full Neolithic.
Houses were dug into the ground and roofed over with timbers
and earth. The dead were buried in enduring chambers of
stone: “dolmens,” often put together out of enormous slabs; or
excavations in soft bed rock. Upright pillars of undressed stone
were erected—either singly as “menhirs” or in “alignments”—in
connection with religious or funerary worship. Pottery
was ornamented in a variety of geometric decorative styles,
usually incised rather than painted; their sequences and contemporary
distributions in several areas are gradually being determined.</p>

<h3 id="section225">225. <span class="smcap">The Bronze Age: Copper and Bronze Phases</span></h3>

<p>There is no abrupt break between the Neolithic and the Bronze
Age. Metal was at first too rare, too difficult to mine and smelt
and work, to be used extensively. It served for special weapons,
tools, and ornaments of the wealthy. The life of the mass of the
population went on in much the old channels for generations
or centuries after the new material had become known. This
was true especially of peoples in oreless regions, or too backward
to have learned the art of metal working. To such nations,
the first bronze came as an imported rarity, to be guarded as a
treasure or heirloom.</p>

<p>Of even less immediate effect than the discovery of bronze, was
that of the first metals known, copper and gold. The latter is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
of course too scarce and too soft to serve for anything but ornaments;
and pure copper also, even when hardened by hammering,
is of little use for many mechanical purposes. It makes a
fairly efficient dagger, a rather mediocre ax, and a poor knife.
The result was that a recognizable period of copper preceded
the true Bronze Age, yet that it was essentially a last phase
of the New Stone Age, with the metal creeping in as something
subsidiary. In Italy and Spain it has therefore become customary
among archæologists to speak of an “Eneolithic” period
as a transition stage in which some copper, and occasionally
bronze of low tin content, occur. In central and northern Europe,
the equivalent stage falls somewhat later and is sometimes
called the Stone-Bronze period.</p>

<p>Bronze is an alloy of tin with copper, harder than the latter,
easier to melt, and casting better. In many properties it resembles
brass, by which term it is referred to in the English
Bible; but must not be confounded with it. Brass is an alloy
of zinc with copper, of much later discovery, apparently in Asia,
and until recent centuries little used in Europe. As regards
bronze, even a two per cent addition of tin to copper results in
a perceptible hardening; and five to ten per cent produce a
greatly superior tool metal.</p>

<p>The origin of bronze is a problem of some difficulty, because
the earliest known users of bronze, the peoples of the Near East,
possessed little or no tin. There are said to have been tin supplies
in the Khorasan district of Persia, which might have been
drawn upon by the pre-Babylonians and thence carried to Egypt.
The chief source of the tin of later antiquity was Spain and
England. But at the outset of the Bronze Age, the Orientals
did not even know of the existence of these countries, while their
natives, still ignorant of copper, could not have mined tin for
the purpose of hardening that basic metal.</p>

<p>Just how, then, bronze was discovered, is still unknown; but
it must have been in Western Asia not later than the fourth
millenium B.C. Before 3000 B.C., in the period of the first
dynasties ruling over united Egypt, the art had been established
in that country, since bronzes low in percentage of tin have been
discovered from that era. While ancient Egypt mined its own
copper in the adjacent Sinai peninsula, it is barren of tin resources,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
so that the latter metal must have been imported.
Within a few centuries, bronze began to be used in Crete and
Troy, and by 2500 B.C. in Italy and Spain, whereas it did not
penetrate central and northern Europe until about 1900 B.C.,
according to the usual estimates. That the use of bronze over
these widespread areas is a connected phenomenon, a case of
single origin and diffusion, is clear from the manner in which
the art spread from its center of invention like a wave which
arrived later the farther it had to travel. The spread is confirmed
by the fact that certain implement forms such as early
triangular daggers and later swords traveled with the material.
Had the western natives discovered bronze for themselves,
they would have cast it into shapes peculiar to themselves, instead
of adopting those long established among the Orientals.</p>

<h3 id="section226">226. <span class="smcap">Traits Associated with Bronze</span></h3>

<p>About coincident with bronze there developed in Egypt and
Babylonia a flood of new arts and inventions: writing; sunburned
brick; stone masonry; sculpture and architecture; the
arch; the plow and later the chariot; the potter’s wheel, which
turns clay vessels with mechanical roundness; astronomical
records and accurate calendars; an enhanced cult of the dead
and greater monuments for them. Many of these elements were
carried into westernmost Asia and the Ægean Islands; not so
many to Italy; fewer still to Spain and France; and a minimum
to central and northern Europe. But it would be an error to
infer from the continued backwardness of the northern peoples
that they were wholly passive and recipient. In their simpler,
more barbaric way, they remodeled much of what they had
carried to them, altered the form, decorated it in their own style,
made much of some item which filled but an insignificant place
in the more complex civilization of the southeast. The fibula
or safety-pin, for instance, was seized upon with avidity by the
central and north European nations, made ornate and tremendously
enlarged, until it sometimes measured half a foot in
length and more than half a pound in weight with spiral whorls,
bosses, pin clasps, or attached rings as big as a palm. The Baltic
nations, the farthest reached by this diffusion, in particular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
threw themselves into the development of the fibula with zest,
success, and a large measure of decorative taste.</p>

<p>Even longer is the history of the sword. This has two lines
of historic development. The one-edged sword or saber tends
to curvature and is essentially a hewing weapon, not intended
for thrusting, or only secondarily so adapted. This form is first
known in western Asia, is apparently of Asiatic origin, and is
the direct ancestor of the Saracen and Indian scimitar, the
Malayan kris and barong, the Japanese samurai’s sword. The
two-edged sword with point has at all times—until after the
introduction of firearms—been the prevailing form in Europe.
Its ancestor is the Egyptian bronze dagger, which in turn is
probably derived from a copper and ultimately a flint blade of
dagger length. The Egyptian dagger never grew to more than
half-sword length, but the type was early carried to Crete and
Italy and Spain. By 2500-2000 B.C. the latter countries were
using triangular wide-bladed daggers of copper and bronze,
with a basal breadth not much less than the length. The handle
was a separate piece, riveted on. Gradually the length grew
greater, the breadth less, the edges more nearly parallel, the
point sharper; the half-sword and then the sword evolved out
of the dagger. The handle, or its spike, came to be cast with
the blade. These drawn-out forms traveling to central and
northern Europe, were made there of greater and greater length,
especially after iron was known. For three thousand years, and
from the southern Mediterranean in its progress to the North
Sea, the sword grew longer and longer, but always by gradual
modification: the whole series of forms shows a transition in both
time and geography. The Greek and Roman sword remained of
thigh length, and was used mainly for thrusting; the Keltic
and Germanic weapon was for hewing and almost unwieldy;
blades so big as to require two-handed swinging finally came to
be employed—a barbaric, ineffective exaggeration to which the
long-cultured Mediterraneans never descended.</p>

<h3 id="section227">227. <span class="smcap">Iron</span></h3>

<p>Iron was worked by man about two thousand years later than
bronze. It is a far more abundant metal than copper, and
though it melts at a higher temperature, is not naturally harder
to extract from some of its ores. The reason for its lateness of
use is not wholly explained. It is likely that the first use of
metals was of those, like gold and copper, that are found in the
pure metallic state and, being rather soft, could be treated by
hammering without heat—by processes more or less familiar to
stone age culture. It is known that fair amounts of copper
were worked in this way by many tribes of North American
Indians, who got their supplies from the Lake Superior deposits
and the Copper River placers in Alaska. If the same thing
happened in the most progressive parts of the Eastern Hemisphere
some 6,000 years ago, acquaintance with the metal may
before long have been succeeded by the invention of the arts
of casting and extracting it from its ores. When, not many centuries
later, the hardening powers of an admixture of tin were
discovered and bronze with its far greater serviceability for
tools became known, a powerful impetus was surely given to the
new metallurgy, which was restricted only by the limitations
of the supply of metal, especially tin. Progress went on in the
direction first taken; the alloy became better balanced, molds
and casting processes superior, the forms attempted more adventurous
or efficient. For many centuries iron ores were disregarded;
the bronze habit intensified. Finally, accident may
have brought the discovery of iron; or shortage of bronze led to
experimenting with other ores; and a new age dawned.</p>

<p>Whatever the forces at work, the actual events were clearly
those outlined. And it is interesting that the New World furnishes
an exact parallel with its three areas and stages of native
copper, smelted copper and gold, and bronze (§ <a href="#section108">108</a>, <a href="#section196">196</a>), and
with only the final period of iron unattained at the time of
discovery.</p>

<h3 id="section228">228. <span class="smcap">First Use and Spread of Iron</span></h3>

<p>Some of the earliest known cases of the use of iron were decorative:
for jewelry, or as inlay upon bronze. Finds of this sort
have been made in Switzerland, Germany, Greece, and the Caucasus.
Once however the extraction of the new material had
become known, its abundance was so great as to further its employment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
which grew fairly rapidly, though held back by several
factors. One of these retarding causes was the prevalence of
the casting process, which had become definitely established for
bronze and was carried on with great skill, whereas iron lends
itself to ready casting only in a foundry and for objects of
larger size than were in customary use among the ancients.
They forged their iron, and this new art had to be gradually
learned. At its best, it could not produce some of the finer
results of casting; in ornaments and statuettes, for instance.</p>

<p>Wrought iron is comparatively soft. A bronze knife will cut
or shave better than a forged iron one. It was not until it was
discovered that the iron from certain ores could be converted
into steel by tempering—plunging the heated implement into
water—that the new metal became a tool material superior to
bronze. The invention of tempering seems to have followed
fairly soon after the discovery of iron. But some centuries
elapsed before this art became at all general.</p>

<p>Finally, conservative fashion operated to delay the undisputed
supremacy of iron. Bronze has an attractive goldenish color;
it oxidizes slowly and superficially; it was anchored in ritual;
and it tended to remain associated with state and splendor, with
wealth and nobility, whereas iron crept into commonplace and
humble usages. Nearly four centuries after iron became known
in the Greek world, the Iliad mentions it but twenty-three times,
bronze two hundred and seventy times. In the Odyssey, a more
bourgeois epic, and a little later in authorship, the proportion
of references to iron is higher: twenty-nine to eighty. The first
four books of the Old Testament, the composition of whose older
parts is usually placed synchronous with that of the Iliad—about
850 B.C.—but whose outlook is the conservative one of
religion, mention iron still more rarely: four times as against
eighty-three references to bronze—“brass” the Authorized Version
calls it.</p>

<p>Which nation first made iron available to the world has not
yet been ascertained. It was almost certainly some people in
western Asia. The Hittites of Asia Minor, the Chalybes of
Armenia, are prominent contenders for the honor. It could
scarcely have been the most civilized people of the region, the
Babylonians, because their alluvial country contains neither ore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span>
nor stone. The time was probably subsequent to 1500 B.C., but
not long after. By the time of Rameses the Great, in the thirteenth
century, the metal was known and somewhat used in
Egypt, being imported from the Hittites. Contemporaneously,
the early Greek invaders who overthrew the Ægean culture of
Crete and Mycenæ and Troy were in the beginnings of the Iron
Age. Italy learned the new material from the Etruscans about
1100 B.C. Babylonian and Assyrian records seem to refer to it
some few centuries earlier. The Jews in the time of Saul, 1000
B.C., are said by the Bible to have had little iron and no steel,
a fact that made possible their oppression by the Philistines of
the coast. This people, apparently descendants of the Minoan
Cretans, have recently been alleged as the discoverers of the
art of steel making; though whether with reason, remains to be
proved. In central Europe iron became fairly abundant about
900 B.C., and was soon mined and smelted locally. In northern
Europe its first sporadic appearance is soon after, but its general
prevalence, justifying the use of the term Iron Age, not
anterior to 500 B.C.</p>

<p>In the Far East, the history of iron is little known. In India,
where it is likely to have been derived from western Asia or
Persia, its first mention is at the end of the Vedic period, whose
close is variously estimated at 1400 B.C. and 1000 B.C. The
metal must have been new then: it was called “dark blue
bronze.” The Hindus later carried knowledge of iron and steel-working
to the Malaysian East Indies.</p>

<p>When China got its first iron is not known, though it appears
to have been comparatively late. By the early part of the
seventh century before Christ, iron had become common enough
to be taxed. But it was used for hoes, plowshares, hatchets,
needles, and domestic purposes only. Not until the fifth century
B.C. did steel-making become introduced into China, and
bronze begin to be superseded for weapons. Even in the first
century after Christ the natives of southernmost China were
fighting with bronze weapons in their struggle against amalgamation
with the empire. At any rate, the Chou dynasty, the
period of the production of the literary classics, from the
eleventh to the third century B.C., was still prevailingly a time
of bronze, as attested both by native historical records and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
evidences of archæology. This lateness of iron in the Far East
raises a strong probability that the Chinese did not enter the
iron stage through their own discovery but were led into it by
the example of Mongol or Turkish peoples of north central Asia,
who in turn leaned upon the western Asiatics.</p>

<p>Japan has a definite Iron Age, well known through excavations.
It is thought to have begun about the fourth century
B.C. This approximate contemporaneity with China, whereas
in nearly all the remainder of its culture Japan borrowed from
China and followed long behind it in time, suggests that the
Japanese or neighboring Koreans may have learned of iron
directly from the north Asiatic teachers of the Chinese.</p>

<h3 id="section229">229. <span class="smcap">The Hallstadt and LaTène Periods</span></h3>

<p>North of the Mediterranean lands, the prehistoric Iron Age
of Europe is divided into two periods: that of Hallstadt, named
after a site in Austria, and lasting from about 900 to 500 B.C.;
and that of LaTène, designated from a famous discovery in
Switzerland, which stretched from 500 B.C. until almost the
birth of Christ. The Hallstadt period is better developed in
middle than in western Europe: it was influenced from Greece,
the Balkans, and Italy. It prevailed along the Adriatic and
Danube as far as Bosnia and Hungary; over all but northern
Germany; in Switzerland; and in eastern France. Its flow
was northwestward. The LaTène culture was carried primarily
by Kelts, falls into the period of their greatest extension
and prosperity, and centers in France. Here it seems to have
developed under the stimulus of Greek colonization at Marseilles,
to have spread northward to the British Isles, and eastward into
central Europe. Its general flow was northeastward.</p>

<p>Considerable iron and bronze work of some technical fineness
was made during the Hallstadt and LaTène periods. Fibulas,
jewelry, weapons, and cult apparatus were often elaborate. But
the quality of the cultures remained homespun, backward, and
barbaric as compared with the plasticity and polish which contemporary
Greek civilization had attained.</p>

<p>The Hallstadt culture, for instance, was wholly without cities,
stone architecture or bridges, paved roads, coins, writing of any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
sort, the potter’s wheel, or rotary millstone; nor was metal used
for agricultural implements. It was a time of villages, small
towns, and scattered homes; of sacred groves instead of temples;
of boggy roads, of ox-carts and solid wooden wheels; of a heavy,
barbaric, warlike population, half like European peasants, half
like pioneers; self-content, yet always dimly conscious that in
the southern distance there lay lands of wealth, refinement, and
achievement.</p>

<p>The LaTène time showed many advances; but, relatively to
the civilizations of Greece and Rome—it was the period of
Phidias and Plato, of Archimedes and Cicero—the northern
culture was as many milestones of progress behind as during
the Hallstadt era. The coins in use were Greek, or local imitations
of Greek money, their figures and legends often corrupted
to complete meaninglessness. Writing was still absent. Some
attempts at script began to be made toward the close of LaTène,
but they resulted in nothing more than the awkward Ogham
and Runic systems. Until perhaps a century or two before
Cæsar, there were no cities or fortified towns in Gaul. When
they arose, it was on heights, behind walls of mixed logs, earth,
and stone, as against the masonry circumvallations which the
Ægean peoples were erecting more than a thousand years before.
Even these poor towns were built only by Kelts; the Germanic
tribes remained shy of them for centuries longer. Society was
still essentially proto-feudal and rustic. But there had filtered
in from the Mediterranean, and were being wrought locally,
holed axes, iron wagon wheels, the potter’s wheel and potter’s
oven, rotary mills, dice, tongs, scissors, saws, and scythes—all
new to these northern lands, and curiously modern in their fundamental
types as compared with the essentially half-primitive,
half-barbarian suggestion that Hallstadt manufactures carry.</p>

<h3 id="section230">230. <span class="smcap">Summary of Development: Regional Differentiation</span></h3>

<p>Two conclusions emerge from the facts reviewed in this chapter
and serve to prevent an over-simple and schematic conception
of the growth of prehistoric civilization. The first is that
successive phases of culture, even in the earliest times, cannot
be identified, much less really understood, by reference to any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
single criterion such as this or that technique of working stone
or the knowledge of this or that metal. In every case the culture
is complex and characterized by a variety of traits whose
combination produces its distinctive cast. The more important
of these culture traits, with particular reference to Europe, may
be summarized thus:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><i>Period</i></th>
    <th><i>Culture Elements Appearing</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Iron</td>
    <td>Iron, steel; in the Orient, alphabet</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bronze</td>
    <td>Metals, alloying, megaliths; in the Orient, masonry, writing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Full Neolithic</td>
    <td>Domesticated animals and plants, stone polishing</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Early Neolithic</td>
    <td>Pottery, bow</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="nw">Upper Palæolithic</td>
    <td>Bone work, harpoon, art</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="nw">Lower Palæolithic</td>
    <td>Fire, flint work</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The second conclusion is that differentiation of culture according
to region is too great to be lightly brushed aside. Even
for the Palæolithic, which is so imperfectly known outside of
Europe, and whose content is so simple, it is clear that the
developmental sequences in Europe cannot be correctly interpreted
without reference to provincial growths and their affiliations
in other continents (§ <a href="#section214">214-216</a>). In the Neolithic, Bronze,
and Iron Ages, regional diversity increases. Egypt and China,
India and France, present deeply differentiated pictures in 3000
B.C., and again in 1000. Their cultures have throughout a
separate aspect. And yet innumerable connections link them.
The very bronze and iron that name the later ages, the grains
and animals that are the basis of their economic life, were intercontinentally
disseminated, and represent in most of the lands
that came to possess them an import from an alien focus of
growth. And currents usually run both ways. China received
metals, wheat, cattle and horses, cotton, architecture, religion,
possibly the suggestion of script, from the west; but she gave
to it silk and porcelain, gunpowder and paper. Also there are
inertias and absences to be reckoned with. The Near East probably
gave to Europe most of the elements of civilization which
the latter possessed during the Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron
periods; but much which the Near East had, it failed to
transmit. Writing flowed into Europe a full two thousand
years after bronze, with which it was coeval in origin. Coinage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
is far later in the Orient than masonry, but outstripped it and
became earlier established in western Europe.</p>

<p>The result is a great tangled web, whose structure is only
gradually being revealed by painstaking comparison and intensive
study. Often the most convincing evidence as to the composition
and direction of the culture currents is provided by
highly specialized matters: styles of pottery decoration, shapes
of ax heads, forms of ornamental safety-pins. It is not because
these minutiæ are so fascinating in themselves that archæologists
are endlessly and often tediously concerned with them. It is
because these data offer the longest clues through the labyrinth,
because on their sure sequences can be strung hundreds of otherwise
non-significant or detached facts. But the results are as
yet incomplete; they are and promise to remain forever complex;
and their systematic presentation in coherent narrative
awaits a larger and future treatment. It will be wisest, in a
work of the present compass, to outline the whole development
of a single area, to serve as a type sample.</p>

<h3 id="section231">231. <span class="smcap">The Scandinavian Area as an Example</span></h3>

<p>The most satisfactory region for such a purpose is Scandinavia—the
peninsula, Denmark, and the Baltic coasts, including
much of northeast Germany. This was a glacier-covered area
in the Mousterian, and either obliterated or uninhabited in the
Upper Palæolithic. It has therefore no Old Stone Age history.
During the Magdalenian, the glaciers had shrunk to cover only
most of the Scandinavian peninsula and Finland. Denmark
was ice-free. But what is now the Baltic stretched as an open
sound from the North Sea across southern Finland and northwestern
Russia to the Arctic Ocean. From this ocean as well
as the remaining glaciers emanated a low temperature, in which
there throve arctic forms of life, especially the small shell
<i>Yoldia arctica</i>, which flourishes only where the sea bottom temperature
ranges between 1° plus and 2° minus Centigrade. This
great, chilly sound of some sixteen to ten thousand years ago
is known as the Yoldia Sea. Denmark and the German coast
must still have been cold, as the remains of the sub-arctic flora
show, and were without human inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span></p>

<h3 id="section232">232. <span class="smcap">The Late Palæolithic Ancylus or Maglemose Period</span></h3>

<p>Around 10,000 B.C., as western Europe was entering upon
the Azilian aftermath of the Palæolithic, the land at both ends
of the Yoldia Sea was elevated sufficiently to cut this off from
the open ocean. The Baltic was thus closed at both ends, instead
of neither, as before, or one only, as now. The rivers continued
to flow into it; it became brackish and almost fresh, and the
fauna changed. The distinctive fossil shell became <i>Ancylus
fluviatilis</i>, from which the great lake is known as the Ancylus
Lake. The Scandinavian flora once more included real trees,
chiefly pines and birches.</p>

<p>Man occupied south Sweden and Denmark in the Ancylus
period. At Maglemose have been found his remains during this
Scandinavian equivalent of the Azilian. Here he appears to
have lived on rafts floating on a lake, which subsequently filled
with peat. Whatever fell overboard, became embedded in the
growing peat and was preserved. The inhabitants cut their
raft logs and firewood with axes of bone and elk horn, some of
them perforated for handles. They had bone fish-hooks, harpoons
with single and double rows of barbs, and still others with
slits for the insertion of minute flint blades, much like saw teeth.
Some of the microlithic points have also been found. All of the
stone was chipped; there is no trace of polishing other than of
bone and antler. They engraved, sometimes in a deteriorated
style of Magdalenian naturalism, sometimes with simple geometric
ornaments. The dog accompanied these people, perhaps
was already half tame. Remains similar to those of Maglemose
have been found in several of the Baltic lands.</p>

<h3 id="section233">233. <span class="smcap">The Early Neolithic Litorina or Kitchenmidden Period</span></h3>

<p>Within perhaps two thousand years, the Baltic opened again
as at present, grew saltier, and took on much its present conditions,
except for being somewhat larger. The water warmed,
and <i>Litorina litorea</i> and the oyster became the characteristic
molluscs. The climate was milder than before, and the forests
changed from birches and pines to oaks.</p>

<p>The men of this period lived largely on oysters and scallops,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
whose shells piled up about their habitations by millions, forming
ridge-like mounds sometimes hundreds of yards long. These
are the Kjökkenmöddings, or Kitchenmiddens, refuse heaps or
shell heaps. Among the shells are ashes, bones of the land animals
and birds that were hunted, and lost or broken utensils.
Some of the Maglemose implements continued to be used, such
as bone awls, chisels, and fish-hooks. Others were no longer
made: harpoons, the minute flint blades, and engraved objects.
But new forms had come in: above all, pottery and the stone
ax—evidences that this was an early period of the Neolithic,
even though polished stone was still lacking. The ax or
“splitter” was chipped—hewn is really a more fitting term—oval
or trapezoidal in outline, the cutting edge convex or
straight. It seems to have been lashed to an elbow handle: there
was no groove or perforation. The pottery was coarse, dark,
and undecorated except sometimes for rows of crude dot impressions
along the edge. Another new implement was a handled
bone comb with four or five teeth. It appears to have been
employed for carding rather than hair-dressing. The bow was
in use: arrowheads bore a cutting edge in front. The dog was
the only domestic or semi-domesticated animal; probably a
Spitz-like breed, perhaps of jackal origin. He managed to gnaw
most of the bones that have been preserved in the shell layers.</p>

<p>Approximately contemporary with the Danish kitchenmiddens,
and similar to them in their cultural repertoire, are a Spanish
phase known as Asturian and the Campignian of northern
France. The Asturian remains are also shell deposits. Their
lower levels contain bones of cattle that had perhaps been
domesticated; middle strata add the sheep; and in the uppermost,
pottery appears. The northern ax is replaced by a handheld
pick. The Campignian possessed hewn axes or splitters
similar to the Danish ones; pottery; domesticated cattle; and
seems to have made a beginning of agriculture with barley. It
would thus seem that pottery and the hewn ax were the characteristic
general criteria of this Early Neolithic stage, with
domesticated animals and agriculture coming in earlier in southern
and middle Europe, whereas the northerners continued to
depend longer on shellfish and game.</p>

<h3 id="section234">234. <span class="smcap">The Full Neolithic and Its Subdivisions in Scandinavia</span></h3>

<p>Two or three thousand years passed, and by about 5500 B.C.
the Scandinavian climate had become slightly cooler once more,
the oaks gave way to birches and pines, the Baltic lost some of
its salt content, and the oyster grew scarcer. The Kitchenmidden
or Litorina period of the Early Neolithic was over; the
Full Neolithic had arrived. Axes were polished, cattle kept,
grain grown. Four Stages of development are discernible.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>5500-3500 B.C. Burials in soil. Sharp-butted axes.</p>

<p>3500-2500 B.C. Burials in dolmens, chambers of three to five flat
upright stones, roofed with one slab. Narrow-butted axes.</p>

<p>2500-2100 B.C. Burials in <i>Allées couvertes</i> or <i>Ganggraeber</i>, chambers
of dolmen type but larger and with a roofed corridor approach. Thick-butted
axes. Some copper. Beautifully neat and even chipping of
flint daggers, lance heads, arrowpoints, some suggesting by their forms
that they may be flint imitations of bronzes already in use on the
Mediterranean. The same is true of perforated stone axes, ground
into ornamental curves, such as are natural in cast metal.</p>

<p>2100-1900 B.C. Burials in stone cysts, progressively decreasing in

of bronze forms continue. The first bronze appears, its percentage

<h3 id="section235">235. <span class="smcap">The Bronze Age and Its Periods in Scandinavia</span></h3>

<p>Bronze reached the Scandinavian region late, as a well
developed art, and its working soon showed a high degree of
technical and æsthetic excellence. But arts that in the Orient
had appeared almost simultaneously with bronze—writing, masonry,
wheel turning of pottery—did not reach Scandinavia
until after bronze had been superseded by iron there. The
consequence was that the Northern culture remained on the
whole thoroughly barbarous. And yet, perhaps on account of
this very backwardness, an aloofness resulted which drove the
Scandinavian bronze-workers to follow their own tastes and
develop their own forms and styles, often with taste as exquisite
as simple. In other words, a local culture grew, much like the
analogous local cultures in America which have been traced in
previous chapters. Yet the basis of this Northern bronze culture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
was southern and Oriental invention; and the south and
east continued to influence Scandinavia. The northern safety-pin,
for instance, underwent the same stages as the southern
one: backs that were first straight and narrow, then sheetlike,
then bowed, with the ends enlarging to great buckles or disks.
But the southern fibula, whatever its type or period, was one-piece
and elastic, the northern at all times made of two separate
parts, and without real spring.</p>

<p>Connection with other countries is evident from the Northern
bronze itself, at least the tin of which, if not the alloy, was
imported. Yet the finds of the Scandinavian Bronze Age,
numerous as they are, do not contain a single specimen that
can be traced to Egypt or to Greece. Even pieces made in
middle Europe are rare. And molds, ladles, unfinished castings,
prove that the North cast its own bronze on the spot. First
knowledge of the art had evidently seeped in from the region
of Switzerland, Austria, and Hungary, which in turn derived
it from the Italian and Balkan peninsulas, which at a still
earlier time had learned it from Egypt or Asia.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that it would be equally erroneous to regard
the Scandinavian Bronze Age as an independent development
or to regard it as a mere copy or importation from the Orient.
It was neither; or, in a sense, it was both. Its origin lies in
the great early focal point of civilization in the Near East; its
specific form, the qualities which it took on, are its own. The
disseminated ingredient, the basis due to diffusion, must be admitted
as fully as the elements of local development which mark
off a distinct Northern culture-area, or sub-focus of cultural
energy.</p>

<p>This interplay of forces is typical also of the Iron and New
Stone Ages, and it is the number of local centers of culture
growth, their increasingly rapid flourishing as time went on,
and the multiplication of connections between countries, that
render the prehistory of Eur-Asiatic civilization so difficult. If
enough were known of the life of the Palæolithic, it is probable
that a similar though less intricate tangle of developments might
be evident for that period also.</p>

<p>The resemblance to the interrelations of areas within America
is manifest. The Southwest stands to southern Mexico as Scandinavia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
does to the Orient: suffused by it, stimulated by it,
created by it, almost; yet at all times with a provincial cast of
its own. The Southwestern specialist can trace a continuous
evolution on the spot which tempts him to forget the obvious
and indisputable Mexican origins. The Mexicanist, on the other
hand, impressed by the practical identity of fundamentals and
close resemblance in many details, is likely to see Southwestern
culture only as a mutilated copy of the higher civilization to the
south. Correct understanding requires the balancing of both
views.</p>

<p>Close equivalents of the culture-areas of American ethnologists
are in fact recognized by European archæologists. Thus,
Déchelette distinguishes seven “geographical provinces” in the
Bronze Age of Europe, as follows: 1, <i>Ægean</i> (Greece, islands,
coast of Asia Minor); 2, <i>Italian</i> (with Sicily and Sardinia);
3, <i>Iberian</i> (Spain, Portugal, Balearics); 4, <i>Western</i> (France,
Great Britain, Ireland, Belgium, southern Germany, Switzerland,
Bohemia); 5, <i>Danubian</i> (Hungary, Moravia, the Balkan
countries); 6, <i>Scandinavian</i> (including northern Germany and
the Baltic coast); 7, <i>Uralic</i> (Russia and western Siberia).</p>

<p>The fourteen hundred years generally allowed the Scandinavian
Bronze Age are divisible into five or six periods,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> which
become progressively shorter.</p>

</div>

<h3 id="section236">236. <span class="smcap">Problems of Chronology</span></h3>

<p>The dating of events in the Neolithic and Metal Ages is of
much more importance than in the Palæolithic. Whether an
invention was made in Babylonia in 5000 or in 3000 B.C. means
the difference between its occurring in the hazy past of a formative
culture or in a well advanced and directly documented
phase of that culture. If the dolmens and other megalithic
monuments of northern Europe were erected about 3000 B.C.,
they are older than the pyramids of Egypt and contemporaneous
with the first slight unfoldings of civilization in Crete and Troy.
But if their date is 1000 B.C., they were set up when pure alphabetic
writing and iron and horses were in use in western Asia,
when Egypt was already senile, and the Cretan and Trojan
cultures half forgotten. In the one case, the megaliths represent
a local achievement, perhaps independent of the stone architecture
of Egypt; in the other event, they are likely to be a belated
and crudely barbarian imitation of this architecture.</p>

<p>But in the Palæolithic, year dates scarcely matter. Whether
the Mousterian phase culminated 25,000 or 75,000 years ago is
irrelevant: it was far before the beginning of historic time in
either case. If one sets the earlier date, the Chellean and Magdalenian
are also stretched farther off; if the later, it is because
one shrinks his estimate of the whole Palæolithic, the sequence
of whose periods remains fixed. It is really only the relative
chronology that counts within the Old Stone Age. The durations
are so great, and so wholly prehistoric, that the only value
of figures is the vividness of their concrete impression on the
mind, and the emphasis that they place on the length of human
antiquity as compared with the brevity of recorded history.
Palæolithic datings might almost be said to be useful in proportion
as they are not taken seriously.</p>

<p>At the same time, the chronology of the Palæolithic is aided
by several lines of geological evidence that are practically absent
for the Neolithic and Bronze Ages: thickness of strata, height
of river deposits and moraines, depth of erosion, species of wild<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
animals. The Neolithic is too brief to show notable traces of
geological processes. Its age must therefore be determined by
subtler means: slight changes in temperature and precipitation;
the thickness of refuse deposits; and above all, the linking of its
latter phases to the earliest datable events in documentary or
inscriptional history. By these aids, comparison has gradually
built up a chronology which is accepted as approximate by
most authorities. This chronology puts the beginning of bronze
in the Baltic region at about 1900 B.C., in Spain at 2500, the
first Swiss lake-dwellings at 4000, the domestication of cattle
and grain in middle Europe around 5500, the first pottery-bearing
shellmounds about 8000 B.C. Of course, these figures
must not be taken as accurate. Estimates vary somewhat. Yet
the dates cited probably represent the opinion of the majority
of specialists without serious deviation: except on one point, and
that an important one.</p>

<p>This point is the hinge from the end of prehistory to the
beginning of history: the date of the first dynasties of Egypt
and Babylonian Sumer. On this matter, there was for many
years a wide discrepancy among Orientalists. The present tendency
is to set 3400 or 3315 B.C., with an error of not over a
century, as the time when upper and lower Egypt began to be
ruled by a single king, Mena, the founder of the “first dynasty”;
2750 as the date of Sargon of Akkad, the first consolidator and
empire-builder in the Babylonian region; and about 3100 as
the period of the earliest discovered datable remains from the
Sumerian city states.</p>

<p>The longer reckoning puts the Egyptian first dynasty back to
about 4000; according to some, even earlier; and Sargon to
3750. This last date rests on the discovery by Nabonidus, the
last king of Babylon, successor of Nebuchadnezzar in the sixth
century B.C., of a deeply buried inscription in a foundation
wall erected by Naram-sin, son of Sargon. Nabonidus had antiquarian
tastes, and set his archæologists and historians to compute
how long before him Naram-sin had lived. Their answer
was 3,200 years—the thirty-eighth century B.C., we should say;
and this figure Nabonidus had put into an inscription which has
come down to us. All this looks direct and sure enough. But
did the king’s scholars really know when they told him that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
just 3,200 years had elapsed since his predecessor’s reign, or
were they guessing? The number is a round one: eighty forties
of years, such as the Old Testament is fond of reckoning with.
The trend of modern opinion, based on a variety of considerations,
is that the Babylonian historians were deceiving either
the king or themselves.</p>

<p>The bearing of the discrepancy is this. The scholars who are
in more or less agreement that bronze reached Mediterranean
Europe about 2500 and Northern Europe about 1900, were generally
building on the longer chronology of the Near East. They
were putting Mena around 4000 and Sargon in 3750. This
allowed an interval of over a thousand years in which bronze
working could have been carried to Spain, and two thousand to
Denmark. With the shorter chronology for Egypt and Babylonia,
the time available for the transmission has to be cut down
by a thousand years. Should the European dates, therefore, be
made correspondingly more recent? Or is the diminished interval
still sufficient—that is, might a few centuries have sufficed
to carry the bronze arts from the Orient to Sicily and
Spain, and a thousand years to bear them to Scandinavia? The
interval seems reasonable, and is accordingly the one here accepted.
But it is possible that if the shorter chronology becomes
proved beyond contradiction for Egypt and Babylonia, the dates
for the Neolithic and Bronze Ages of Europe may also have to
be abbreviated somewhat.</p>

<p>One famous time-reckoning has in fact been made by the
Dane Sophus Müller, who, without basing very much on any
Oriental chronology, shortens all the prehistoric periods of
Europe. His scheme of approximate dating is reproduced, with
some simplifications, in <a href="#figure42">Figure 42</a>. It will be seen that he sets
the second or dolmen period of the Full Neolithic in Scandinavia
from about 1800 to 1400 B.C., whereas the more usual
reckoning puts it at 3500 to 2500; his earliest Kitchenmidden
date is 4000, as against 8000.</p>

<h3 id="section237">237. <span class="smcap">Principles of the Prehistoric Spread of Culture</span></h3>

<p>This chronology has much to commend it besides its almost
daring conservatism; especially the clarity of its consistent
recognition of certain cultural processes. Five principles and
three extensions are set up by Müller:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. The south [of Europe, with the Near East] was the vanguard
and dispensing source of culture; the peripheral regions, especially
in the north [of Europe] followed and received.</p>

<p>2. The elements of southern culture were transmitted to the north
only in reduction and extract.</p>

<p>3. They were also subject to modifications.</p>

<p>4. These elements of southern culture sometimes appeared in the
remoter areas with great vigor and new qualities of their own.</p>

<p>5. But such remote appearances are later in time than the occurrence
of the same elements in the south.</p>

<p>6. Forms of artifacts or ornaments may survive for a long time with
but little modification, especially if transmitted to new territory.</p>

<p>7. Separate elements characteristic of successive periods in a culture
center may occur contemporaneously in the marginal areas, their
diffusion having occurred at different rates of speed.</p>

<p>8. Marginal cultures thus present a curious mixture of traits whose
original age is great and of others that are much newer; the latter,
in fact, occasionally reach the peripheries earlier than old traits.</p>

</div>

<p>The basic idea of these formulations is that of the gradual
radiation of culture from creative focal centers to backward
marginal areas, without the original dependence of the peripheries
wholly precluding their subsequent independent development.
It is obvious that this point of view is substantially identical
with that which has been held to in the presentation of
native American culture in the preceding chapter.</p>

<p>It is only fair to say that a number of eminent archæologists
combat the prevalent opinion that the sources of European Neolithic
and Bronze Age civilization are to be derived almost wholly
from the Orient. They speak of this view as an “Oriental
mirage.” They see more specific differences than identities between
the several local cultures of the two regions, and tend to
explain the similarities as due to independent invention.</p>

<p>Since knowledge of ancient cultures is necessarily never complete,
there is a wide range of facts to which either explanation
is, theoretically, applicable. But the focal-marginal diffusion
interpretation has the following considerations in its favor.</p>

<p>Within the fully historic period, there have been numerous
undoubted diffusions, of which the alphabet, the week, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
true arch may be taken as illustrations. At least in the earlier
portion of the historic period, the flow of such diffusions was
regularly out of the Orient; which raises a considerable presumption
that the flow was in the same direction as early as the
Neolithic. On the other hand, indubitably independent parallelisms
are very difficult to establish within historic areas and
periods, and therefore likely to have been equally rare during
prehistory.</p>

<p>Then, too, the diffusion interpretation explains a large part
of civilization to a certain degree in terms of a large, consistent
scheme. To the contrary, the parallelistic opinion leaves the
facts both unexplained and unrelated. If the Etruscans devised
the true arch and liver divination independently of the Babylonians,
there are two sets of phenomena awaiting interpretation
instead of one. To say that they are both “natural” events
is equivalent to calling them accidental, that is, unexplainable.
To fall back on instinctive impulses of the human mind will
not do, else all or most nations should have made these inventions.</p>

<p>Of course it is important to remember that no sane interpretation
of culture explains everything. We do not know what
caused the true arch to be invented in Babylonia, hieroglyphic
writing in Egypt, the alphabet in Phœnicia, at a certain time
rather than at another or rather than in another place. The
diffusion point of view simply accepts certain intensive focal
developments of culture as empirically given by the facts, and
then relates as many other facts as possible to these. Every
clear-minded historian, anthropologist, and sociologist admits
that we are still in ignorance on the problems of what caused
the great bursts of higher organization and original productiveness
of early Egypt and Sumer, of Crete, of ancient North
China, of the Mayas, of Periclean Athens. We know many of
the events of civilization, know them in their place and order.
We can infer from these something of the processes of imitation,
conservatism, rationalization that have shaped them. We
know as yet as good as nothing of the first or productive causes
of civilization.</p>

<p>It is extremely important that this limitation of our understanding
be frankly realized. It is only awareness of darkness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
that brings seeking for light. Scientific problems must be felt
before they can be grappled. But within the bounds of our
actual knowledge, the principle of culture derivation and transmission
seems to integrate, and thus in a measure to explain, a
far greater body of facts than any other principle—provided it
is not stretched into an instrument of magic and forced to explain
everything.</p>

<h3 id="section238">238. <span class="smcap">The Early Focal Area</span></h3>

<p>The prehistoric archæology of Europe and the Near East,
outlined in the last chapter, besides arriving at a tolerable
chronology, reveals a set of processes of which the outstanding
one is the principle of the origin of culture at focal centers and
its diffusion to marginal tracts. Obviously this principle should
apply in the field of history as well as prehistory, and should
be even more easily traceable there.</p>

<p>In the Western Hemisphere it is plain that the great hearth
of cultural nourishment and production has been Middle
America—the tracts at the two ends of the intercontinental
bridge, the Isthmus of Panama. That a similarly preëminent
focal area existed in the Eastern Hemisphere has been implied
over and over again in the pages that immediately precede this
one, in the references to the priority of Egypt and Babylonia—the
countries of the Nile and of the Two Rivers. These two
lands lie at no great distance from each other: they are closer
than Mexico and Peru. Like these two, they are also connected
by a strip of mostly favorable territory—the “Fertile Crescent”
of Palestine, Syria, and northern Mesopotamia. Curiously, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
two countries also lie in two continents connected by a land
bridge: the Isthmus of Suez is a parallel to that of Panama.</p>

<p>Both in Egypt and in Babylonia we find a little before 3000
B.C. a system of partly phonetic writing, which, though cumbersome
by modern standards, was adequate to record whatever was
spoken. Copper was abundant and bronze in use for weapons
and tools. Pottery was being turned on wheels. Economic life
was at bottom agricultural. The same food plants were grown:
barley and wheat; similar beer brewed from them. The same
animals were raised: cattle, swine, sheep, goats; with the ass
for transport. Architecture was in sun-dried brick. Considerable
walled cities had arisen. Their rulers struggled or attained
supremacy over one another as avowed kings with millions of
subjects. A regulated calendar existed by which events were
dated. There were taxes, governors, courts of law, police protection,
and social order. A series of great gods, with particular
names and attributes, were worshiped in temples.</p>

<h3 id="section239">239. <span class="smcap">Egypt and Sumer and Their Background</span></h3>

<p>It is scarcely conceivable that these two parallel growths of
civilization, easily the most advanced that had until then appeared
on earth, should have sprung up independently within
a thousand miles of each other. Had Sumerian culture blossomed
far away, say on the shores of the Pacific instead of the
lower Euphrates, its essential separateness, like that of Middle
American civilization, might be probable. But not only is the
stretch of land between Babylonia and Egypt relatively short:
it is, except in the Suez district, productive and pleasant, and
was settled fairly densely by relatively advanced nations soon
after the historic period opens or even before. The same is true
of the adjoining regions. Canaan, Syria, Mesopotamia, Troy,
Crete, Elam, southwestern Turkistan, had all passed beyond
barbarism and into the period of city life during the fourth
and third millenia B.C. This cannot be a series of coincidences.
Evidently western Asia, together with the nearest European
islands and the adjacent fertile corner of Africa, formed a
complex but connected unit, a larger hearth in which culture
was glowing at a number of points. It merely happened that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
a little upstream from the mouths of the Nile and of the
Euphrates the development flamed up faster during the fifth
and fourth millenia. The causes can only be conjectured.
Perhaps when agriculture came to be systematically instead of
casually conducted, these annually overflowed bottom lands
proved unusually favorable; their population grew, necessitating
fixed government and social order, which in turn enabled
a still more rapid growth of numbers, the fuller exploitation of
resources, and division of labor. This looks plausible enough.
But too much weight should not be attached to explanations of
this sort: they remain chiefly hypothetical. That culture had
however by 3000 B.C. attained a greater richness and organization
in Egypt and in the Babylonian region than elsewhere,
are facts, and can hardly be anything but causally connected
facts. These two civilizations had evidently arisen out of a
common Near Eastern high level of Neolithic culture, much as
the peaks of Mexico and Peru arose above the plateau of Middle
American culture in which they were grounded.</p>

<p>Of course this means that Egypt and Sumer did not stand
in parental-filial relation. They were rather collateral kin—brothers,
or better, perhaps, the two most eminent of a group
of cousins. Attempts to derive Egyptian hieroglyphic from
Babylonian Cuneiform writing, and vice versa, have been rejected
as unproved by the majority of unbiased scholars. But
it is likely that at least the idea of making legible records, of
using pictorial signs for sounds of speech, was carried from one
people to the other, which thereupon worked out its own symbols
and meanings. Just so, while the Phœnician alphabet has
never yet been led back to either Egyptian, Cuneiform, Cretan,
or Hittite writing with enough evidence to satisfy more than
a minority fraction of the world of scholarship, it seems incredible
that this new form of writing should have originated
uninfluenced by any of the several systems which had been in
current use in the near neighborhood, in part in Phœnicia itself,
for from one to two or three thousand years. Such a view denies
neither the essentially new element in Phœnician script nor its
cultural importance. It does not consider the origin of the
alphabet explained away by a reference to another and earlier
system of writing. It does bring the alphabet into some sort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
of causal relation with the other systems, without merging it in
them. It is along lines like this that the relation of early Egypt
and Babylonia to each other and to the other cultures of the
ancient Near East must be conceived.</p>

<h3 id="section240">240. <span class="smcap">Predynastic Egypt</span></h3>

<p>Egyptian civilization was already in full blown flower at the
time of the consolidation of Lower and Upper Egypt under the
first dynasty in the thirty-fourth century. Its developmental
stages must have reached much farther back. Hieroglyphic
writing, for instance, had taken on substantially the forms and
degree of efficiency which it maintained for the next three thousand
years. An elaborate, conventional system of this sort must
have required centuries for its formative stages. A non-lunar
365-day calendar was in use. This was easily the most accurate
and effective calendar developed in the ancient world, and furnished
the basis of our own. It erred by the few hours’ difference
between the solar and the assumed year. This difference
the Egyptians did not correct but recorded, with the result that
when the initial day had slowly swung around the cycle of the
seasons, they reckoned a “Sothic year” of 1,461 years. One
of these was completed in 2781; which gives 4241 B.C. as the
date of the fixing of the calendar. This is considered the earliest
exactly known date in human history. Of course, a calendar
of such fineness cannot be established without long continued
observations, whose duration will be the greater for lack of
astronomical instruments. Centuries must have elapsed while
this calendar was being worked out. Nor would oral tradition
be a sufficient vehicle for carrying the observations. Permanent
records must have been transmitted from generation to generation;
and these presuppose stability of society, enduring buildings,
towns, and a class with leisure to devote to astronomical
computations. It is safe therefore to set 4500 B.C. as the time
when Egypt had emerged from a tribal or rural peasant condition
into one that can be called “civilized” in the original meaning
of that word: a period of city states, or at least districts
organized under recognized rulers. From 4500 on, then, is the
time of the Predynastic Local Kingdoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span></p>

<p>Beyond this time there must lie another: the Predynastic
Tribal period, before towns or calendars or writing or metal,
when pottery was being made, stone ground, boats built, plants
and animals being domesticated—the typical pure Neolithic
Age, in short. Yet with all its prehistoric wealth, Egypt has
not yet produced any true Neolithic remains. It is hardly likely
that the country was uninhabited for thousands of years; much
more probably have Neolithic remains been obliterated. This
inference is strengthened by the paucity and dubiousness of
Upper Palæolithic artifacts in Egypt. Lower Palæolithic flint
implements are abundant, just as are remains from the whole
of the period of metals. What has happened to the missing
deposits and burials of the Upper Palæolithic and Neolithic
that fell between?</p>

<p>Apparently they have been buried on the floor of the Nile
valley under alluvial deposits. The Eolithic and Lower Palæolithic
implements are found on the plateau through which the
valley stretches; also cemented into conglomerate formed of
gravel and stone washed down from this plateau and cut into
terraces by the Nile when it still flowed from 30 to 100 feet
higher than at present; and on the terraces. Just when these
terraces were formed, it is difficult to say in terms of European
Pleistocene periods; but not later than the third glacial epoch,
it would seem, and perhaps as early as the second. As the Chellean
of Europe is put after the third glaciation in the chronology
followed in this book, the antiquity of the first flints used,
and perhaps deliberately shaped, in Egypt, is carried back to
an extremely high antiquity by the specimens imbedded in the
terrace cliffs.</p>

<p>About the time of the last glaciation—the Mousterian or end
of the Lower Palæolithic in Europe—the Nile ceased cutting
down through the gravels that bordered it and began to build
up its bed and its valley with a deposit of mud as it does to-day.
From excavations to the base of dated monuments it is known
that during the last 4,000 years this alluvium has been laid
down at the rate of a foot in 300 years in northern Egypt. As
it there attains a depth of over a hundred feet, the process of
deposition is indicated as having begun 30,000 or more years
ago. Of course no computation of this sort is entirely reliable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
because various factors can enter to change the rate; but the
probability is that, other things equal, the deposition would have
been slower at first than of late, and the time of the aggrading
correspondingly longer. In any event geologists agree that their
Recent—the last 10,000 years or so—is insufficient, and that the
deposition of the floor of the Nile valley must have begun during
what in Europe was part of the Würm glaciation.</p>

<p>This is the period of transition from Lower to Upper Palæolithic
(§ <a href="#section69">69</a>, <a href="#section70">70</a>, <a href="#section213">213</a>) in Europe. The disappearance of Upper
Palæolithic remains in Egypt is most plausibly explained by the
fact that the Upper Palæolithic, just as later the Neolithic, was
indeed represented in Egypt, very likely flourishingly, but that
in the mild climate its artifacts were lost or interred on or near
the surface of the valley itself and have therefore long since
been covered over so deep that only future lucky accidents, like
well-soundings, may now and then bring a specimen to light.</p>

<p>For the Neolithic, there actually are such discoveries: bits
of pottery brought up from borings, 60 feet deep in the vicinity
of one of the monuments referred to, 75 and 90 feet deep at
other points in lower Egypt. The smallest of these figures computes
to a lapse of 18,000 years—nearly twice as long as the
estimated age of the earliest pottery in Europe. It is always
necessary not to lay too much reliance on durations calculated
solely from thickness of strata, whether these are geological or
culture-bearing. But in this case general probability confirms,
at least in the rough. In 4000 B.C., when Egypt was beginning
to use copper, western Europe was still in its first phase of stone
polishing; in 1500 B.C., when Egypt was becoming acquainted
with iron, Europe was scarcely yet at the height of its bronze
industry. If the fisher folk camped on their oyster shells on
the Baltic shores were able to make pottery by 8000 B.C., there
is nothing staggering in the suggestion that the Egyptians knew
the art in 16,000 B.C. They have had writing more than twice
as long as the North Europeans.</p>

<p>The dates themselves, then, need not be taken too literally.
They are calculated from slender even though impressive evidence
and subject to revision by perhaps thousands of years.
But they do suggest strongly the distinct precedence of northern
Africa, and by implication of western Asia, over Europe in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[446]</span>
Neolithic, as precedence is clear in the Bronze and early Iron
Ages and indicated for the Lower Palæolithic.</p>

<p>If, accordingly, the beginning of the Early Neolithic—the age
of pottery, bow, dog—be set for Egypt somewhere around
16,000 B.C., about coeval with the beginning of the Magdalenian
in middle western Europe (§ <a href="#section215">215</a>), the Full Neolithic, the time
of first domestication of animals and plants and polishing of
stone, could be estimated at around 10,000 B.C., when Europe
was still lingering in its epi-Palæolithic phase (§ <a href="#section216">216</a>). One
can cut away several thousand years and retain the essential
situation unimpaired: 8000, or 7000 B.C., still leaves Egypt in
the van; helps to explain the appearance of eastern grains and
animals in Europe around 6000-5000 B.C.; and, what is most
to the point, allows a sufficient interval for agriculture and the
allied phases of civilization to have reached the degree of development
which they display when the Predynastic Local
Kingdoms drift into our vision around 4500 B.C. A long Full
Neolithic, then, is both demanded by the situation in Egypt
and indicated by such facts as there are; a long period in which
millet, barley, split-wheat, wheat, flax, cattle, sheep, and asses
were gradually modified and made more useful by breeding
under domestication. This Full Neolithic, or its last portion,
was the Predynastic Tribal Age of Egypt; which, when it passed
into the Predynastic Local Kingdoms phase about 4500 B.C.,
had brought these plants and animals substantially to their modern
forms, and had increased and coördinated the population
of the land to a point that the devising of calendar, metallurgy,
writing, and kingship soon followed.</p>

<h3 id="section241">241. <span class="smcap">Culture Growth in Dynastic Egypt</span></h3>

<p>The story of the growth of Egyptian civilization during the
Dynastic or historic period is a fascinating one. There were
three phases of prosperity and splendor. The first was the Old
Kingdom, 3000-2500, culminating in the fourth dynasty of the
Great Pyramid builders, in the twenty-ninth century. The
second was the Middle or Feudal Kingdom, with its climax in
the twelfth dynasty, 2000-1788. After the invasion of the Asiatic
Hyksos in the seventeenth century, the New Empire of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[447]</span>
eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties arose, whose greatest extension
fell in the reign of Thutmose III, 1501-1447, although
the country retained some powers of offensive for a couple of
centuries longer. There followed a slow nationalistic decline, a
transient seventh century conquest by Assyria, a brief and fictitious
renascence supported by foreign mercenaries, and the
Persian conquest of 525 B.C., since which time Egypt has never
been an independent power under native rulers. A waning of
cultural energy, at least relatively to other peoples, had set in
before the military decline. By 1000 B.C. certainly, by 1500
perhaps, Egypt was receiving more elements of civilization than
she was imparting. She still loomed wealthy and refined in
contrast with younger nations; but these were producing more
that was new.</p>

<p>Copper smelted from the ores of the Sinai peninsula had
apparently come into use by 4000, but remained scarce for a
long time. The first dynasty had some low grade bronze; by
2500 bronze containing a tenth of tin was in use. Iron was
introduced about 1500 or soon after, but for centuries remained
a sparing Asiatic import. In fact, the conservatism that was
settling over the old age of the civilization caused it to cling
with unusual tenacity to bronze. As late as Ptolemaic and
Roman times, when the graves of foreigners abounded in iron,
those of Egyptians were still prevailingly bronze furnished.</p>

<p>Quite different must have been the social psychology three
thousand years earlier. The first masonry was laid in place of
adobe brick to line tomb walls in the thirty-first century; and
within a century and a half the grandest stone architecture in
human history had been attained in the Pyramid of Cheops.
This was a burst of cultural energy such as has been equalled
only in the rise of Greek art or modern science.</p>

<p>Glass making seems to have been discovered in Egypt in the
early dynasties and to have spread from there to Syria and the
Euphrates. The earliest glass was colored faïence, at most translucent,
and devoted chiefly to jewelry, or to surfacing brick.
Later it was blown into vessels, usually small bottles, and only
gradually attained to clearness. From western Asia the art was
carried to Europe, and, in Christian times, to China, which at
first paid gem prices for glass beads, but later was perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[448]</span>
stimulated by knowledge of the new art into devising porcelain—a
pottery vitrified through.</p>

<p>The horse first reached Egypt with the Hyksos. With it came
the war chariot. Wheeled vehicles seem to have been lacking
previously. The alphabet, the arch, the zodiac, coinage, heavy
metal armor, and many other important inventions gained no
foot-hold in Egypt until after the country had definitely passed
under foreign domination. The superior intensity of early
Egyptian civilization had evidently fostered a spirit of cultural
self-sufficiency, analogous to that of China or Byzantine Greece,
which produced a resistance to innovation from without. At
the same time, inward development continued, as attested by
numerous advances in religion, literature, dress, the arts, and
science when the Old Kingdom and New Empire are compared.
In the eleventh and twelfth dynasties, for instance, the monarchy
was feudal; in the eighteenth lived the famous monotheistic
iconoclastic ruler Ikhnaton.</p>

<p>The civilization of ancient Egypt was wholly produced and
carried by a Hamitic-speaking people. This people has sometimes
been thought to have come from Asia, but its Hamitic
relatives hold Africa from Somaliland to Morocco even to-day,
and there is no cogent reason to look for its ancestors outside
that continent.</p>

<h3 id="section242">242. <span class="smcap">The Sumerian Development</span></h3>

<p>The story of Babylonia is less completely known than that of
Egypt because as a rockless land it was forced to depend on
sun-dried brick, because the climate is less arid, and also because
of its position. Egypt was isolated by deserts, Babylonia open
to many neighbors, and so was invaded, fought over, and never
unified as long as Egypt. The civilization was therefore never
so nationally specific, so concentrated; and its records, though
abundant, are patchy. Babylonia, the region of the lower
Euphrates and Tigris, was the leading culture center of Asia
in the third and second millenia before Christ; and while mostly
a Semitic land in this period, its civilization was the product
of another people, the Sumerians, established near the mouth
of the two rivers in the fourth millenium. It was the Sumerians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[449]</span>
who in this thousand years worked out the Cuneiform or wedge-shaped
system of writing—mixedly phonetic and ideographic
like the Egyptian, but of wholly different values, so far as can
be told to-day, and executed in straight strokes instead of the
pictorial forms of Hieroglyphic or the cursive ones of its derivative
Hieratic. It was the Semites who, coming in from the
Arabian region, took over this writing, together with the culture
that accompanied it. Their dependence is shown by the fact
that they used characters with Sumerian phonetic values as well
as by their retention of Sumerian as a sacred language, for
which, as time went on, they were compelled to compile dictionaries,
to the easement of modern archæologists.</p>

<p>Of the local origins of this Sumerian city-state civilization
with its irrigation and intensive agriculture, nothing is known.
It kept substantially abreast of Egypt, or at most a few centuries
in arrears. In certain features, as the use of metals, it
seems to have been in advance. Egypt is a long-drawn oasis
stretched through a great desert. Babylonia lies adjacent to
desert and highland, steppe and mountains. Within a range of
a few hundred miles, its environment is far more varied. Not
only copper but tin is said to have been available among neighboring
peoples. So, too, Babylonia is likely to have had the
early domestic animals—except perhaps cattle—earlier than
Egypt, because it lay nearer to what seem to have been their
native habitats. The result is that whereas Egyptian culture
makes the superficial impression of having been largely evolved
on the spot by the Egyptians, Sumerian culture already promises
to resolve, when we shall know it better, into a blend to
which a series of peoples contributed measurably. The rôle
of the Sumerians, like that of their Semitic successors, was perhaps
primarily that of organizers.</p>

<h3 id="section243">243. <span class="smcap">The Sumerian Hinterland</span></h3>

<p>There are some evidences of these cultures previous to the
Sumerian one or coeval with it. In Elam, the foot-hill country
east of Sumer, a mound at Susa contains over 100 feet of culture-bearing
deposits; in southern Turkistan, at Anau, 300 miles east
of the Caspian sea, one is more than fifty feet deep. The date<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[450]</span>
of the first occupancy of these sites has been set, largely on the
basis of the rate of accumulation of the deposits—an unsafe
criterion—at 18,000 and 8000 B.C. respectively. These dates,
particularly the former, are surely too high. But a remote
antiquity is indicated. Both sites show adobe brick houses and
hand-made, painted pottery at the very bottom. Susa contains
copper implements in the lowest stratum; Anau, three-fourths
way to the base—in the same level as remains of sheep and
camels. Still lower levels at Anau yielded remains of tamed
cattle, pigs, and goats, while wheat and barley appear at the
very bottom, before domesticated animals were kept. Whatever
the date of the introduction of copper in these regions, it was
very likely anterior to the thirty-first century, when bronze was
already used by the Sumerians. These excavations therefore
shed light on the Full Neolithic and Eneolithic or Transition
phases of west Asiatic culture which must have preceded the
Sumerian civilization known to us.</p>

<p>The languages of these early west Asiatic peoples have not
been classified. Sumerian was non-Indo-European, non-Semitic,
non-Hamitic. Some have thought to detect Turkish, that is
Ural-Altaic, resemblances in it. But others find similarities to
modern African languages. This divergence of opinion probably
means that Sumerian cannot yet be safely linked with any
other linguistic group. The same applies to Elamite, which is
known from inscriptions of a later date than the early strata
at Susa. What the Neolithic and Bronze Age people of Anau
spoke there is no means of knowing. The region at present is
Turkish, but this is of course no evidence that it was so thousands
of years ago. The speech of the region might conceivably
have been Indo-European, for it lies at the foot of the Persian
plateau, which by the Iron Age was occupied by the Iranian
branch of the Indo-Europeans, who are generally thought to
have entered it from the north or northwest. But again there
is not a shred of positive evidence for an Indo-European population
at this wholly prehistoric period. The one thing that is
clear is that the early civilization of the general west Asiatic
area was not developed by the Semites who were its chief carriers
later. This is a situation parallel to that obtaining in
Europe and Asia Minor, whose civilization in the full historic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451"></a>[451]</span>
period has been almost wholly in the hands of Indo-Europeans,
whereas at the dawn of history the nations who were culturally
in the lead, the Hittites, Trojans, Cretans, Lydians, Etruscans,
and Iberians, were all non-Indo-European.</p>

<h3 id="section244">244. <span class="smcap">Entry of Semites and Indo-Europeans</span></h3>

<p>The Semitic invasions seem to have proceeded from the great
motherland of that stock, Arabia, whose deserts and half-deserts
have been at all times like a multiplying hive. Some of the
movements were outright conquests, others half-forceful penetrations,
still others infiltrations. Several great waves can be
distinguished. About 3000 there was a drift which brought the
Akkadians, Sargon’s people, into Babylonia, perhaps the Assyrians
into their home up the Tigris, the Canaanites and Phœnicians
into the Syrian region. About 2200 the Amorites flowed
north: into Babylonia, where Babylon now sprang up and the
famous lawgiver Hammurabi ruled; into Mesopotamia proper;
and into Syria. Around 1400, the Aramæans gradually occupied
the Syrian district, and the Hebrews began to dispossess
the Canaanites. Around 700 still another wave brought the
Chaldæans into Babylonia, to erect a great Semitic kingdom
once more—that of Nebuchadnezzar. Then, for more than a
thousand years, Arabia lay contained within herself, dammed
perhaps by the Persian, Macedonian, Parthian, and Roman empires,
until in the seventh century after Christ Mohammedanism
led forth her peoples. A much earlier movement, at an unknown
time, had brought the forefathers of the Abyssinians
across the mouth of the Red Sea into Africa, and the Hyksos
who overthrew the Middle Kingdom of ancient Egypt may have
been Semites.</p>

<p>The Indo-Europeans entered southwest Asia later and permeated
it more locally than the Semites. Soon after 2000 the
Kassites or Kossæans intruded into Babylonia; they seem to
have been Indo-Europeans, perhaps Iranians. Around 1500 the
Mitanni were a power on the upper Euphrates between the Assyrians
and the Hittites of Asia Minor. Their personal and
god names as preserved in Assyrian Cuneiform inscriptions
show them to have been an Iranian people. The latter are not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452"></a>[452]</span>
recognizably referred to in their permanent home on the Iranian
plateau until about 1000, but may well have settled there a thousand
years earlier. Their close relatives, the Indic branch, are
believed to have begun their entry of India about 2000-1500
B.C. or soon after.</p>

<h3 id="section245">245. <span class="smcap">Iranian Peoples and Cultures</span></h3>

<p>By the seventh century B.C., the Iranians were civilized and
strong enough to participate in the overthrow of Semitic Assyria,
whose principal inheritors they became. From then on
for over twelve hundred years, with only a century of interruption
due to Alexander and his successors, a succession of Iranian
powers dominated not only the plateau but Babylonia and Mesopotamia:
Medes, Achæmenian Persians, Parthians, Sassanian
Persians. A strong national consciousness was evolved and reinforced
by a national religion—Zoroastrianism, Magism, Fire-worship,
the Avestan faith, are some of its names. This Iranian
religion endured nearly three thousand years, and still survives
among a shrunken number of followers, notably the emigrant
Parsis—that is, “Persians”—of India; and its basic ideas
of the eternal conflict of good and evil, truth and lie, and of a
single supreme deity of righteousness, have influenced many
other cults, including Christianity. The long contact between
Iran and the Tigris-Euphrates valley and their frequent political
unity since 600 B.C. reacted favorably to the intensification
of culture in the highlands; with the result that when the
Arabs and later the Turks broke from their marginal homes into
the old civilized parts of western Asia, they absorbed heavily
from the long established cultures of Iran. Much of Arab and
Turkish civilization is really Persian, and goes back ultimately
to Semitic Babylonian and Sumerian origins.</p>

<p>Soon after the Iranians pushed southward out of the steppe
on to the plateau east of the Caspian, other Indo-Europeans
drove southward west of the Caspian and Black Sea; the Armenians
into the seats which they have held ever since, the
Kardouchoi into the Kurd country, tribes allied to the Balkan
Thracians and the Phrygians into Asia Minor. The centuries
before and after 1000 B.C. were the period of these movements,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453"></a>[453]</span>
all of which failed to penetrate as deeply into the heart of the
west Asiatic cultural center as had the Semitic inflows. Nor
was the Indo-Europeanization of all the newly occupied territories
as permanent as the corresponding Semitization. Asia
Minor, which is now prevailingly Turkish, is the one area of
consequence that in the historic period has been de-Indo-Europeanized
in speech (§ <a href="#section50">50</a>).</p>

<h3 id="section246">246. <span class="smcap">The Composite Culture of the Near East</span></h3>

<p>In this western end of Asia, then, from the Hellespont to
Persia and from the Caucasus to the Arabian desert, beginning
five thousand years ago and probably more, a motley of nations
was thrown together—autochthonous peoples of several sorts,
Semites, Indo-Europeans, possibly Ural-Altaians. Their contacts
enabled each to acquire many of the new devices developed
by the others, to combine these with their own attainments, and
thus to be a source of culture stimulation over again for the
others. The largest tract of rich lowland in the area was the
Fertile Crescent which bowed from Jerusalem northward and
eastward into Mesopotamia and then down the course of the
Tigris and Euphrates to their mouths, and here, for several millenia,
civilization tended to advance most intensively. Within
this Crescent, again, its southeastern end, the drainable and
irrigable alluvial plain of Babylonia, averaged in the lead from
the earliest known Sumerian times until shortly before the
Christian era. Yet political dominance often shifted elsewhere:
to Egypt, which conquered to the Euphrates in the fifteenth
century B.C.; to the Hittites of Asia Minor in the fourteenth
and thirteenth; to the Assyrians of the middle Tigris in the
twelfth and eleventh and again in the eighth and seventh centuries.
Culturally, too, almost every one of the many nations
or tracts comprised within the west Asiatic area developed a
degree of independence; each added features or modified those
which it borrowed; each gave to its local civilization a cast of
its own, without losing touch with the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454"></a>[454]</span></p>

<h3 id="section247">247. <span class="smcap">Phœnicians, Aramæans, Hebrews</span></h3>

<p>Thus, the Phœnicians, or some Semitic people closely related
and geographically near them, by 1000 B.C. developed, presumably
out of one of the several part-phonetic or syllabic writings
in use about or among them, the true alphabet (§ <a href="#section134">134</a>).
In the two or three centuries following, they established a commercial
and maritime supremacy over the Mediterranean that
led to the founding of Carthage, direct trade as far as Spain and
indirect to Britain, and transmission of the alphabet and other
knowledge to the Greeks.</p>

<p>Another trading people, although an inland one, were the
Aramæans, Semites of the same wave as the Hebrews but established
north of Palestine in Syria, with Damascus as their
greatest center. Never more than a secondary political power,
they penetrated other countries peacefully, brought in their
system of measures and weights, their writing, and even their
language. Assyria had become half Aramaic speaking by the
time of her fall, and the every-day language of Palestine in the
days of Jesus and for some centuries before was Aramaic.
Aramæan script, a cursive form of the Phœnician alphabet,
gradually replaced Cuneiform writing, first for business and
then for official purposes, throughout western Asia and beyond.
In the fourteenth century, the Syrian and Palestinian city
rulers had written their reports and dispatches to the Egyptian
overlord in Cuneiform, which a corps of clerks in the Foreign
Office or Dependencies Department at Tell-el-Amarna transcribed
into Hieroglyphic or Hieratic. In the fourth century,
Persian officials were employing Aramæan for official communications.
As the Cuneiform more and more died out, derivatives
of Aramæan became the alphabets of Persia; of at least part
and possibly the whole of India; of the Jews; of the Arabs;
of the Nestorian Christians; and of the ancient Turks, the
Mongols, and the Manchus. Practically all Asia except perhaps
India, so far as it writes alphabetically, thus derives its letters
from an Aramæan source (§ <a href="#section146">146</a>).</p>

<p>Equally profound was the influence of the neighboring Hebrews
in another phase of civilization. At the time they first
entered history, about 1400 B.C., the Hebrews worshiped a tribal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455"></a>[455]</span>
god Jahveh. They believed that there were many gods beside
him, but that they were his people and he their god. A growing
national consciousness led them more and more to emphasize the
special relation between him and them, to the exclusion of worship
of other deities which was constantly creeping in from
their Canaanite, Phœnician, Aramæan, and Egyptian neighbors.
Thus they grew into the stage of monolatry, or worship limited
to one god. As however Assyria and Babylonia first threatened
and then engulfed them, and their national impotence became
more and more evident, they confided less in themselves, as they
had done in the brief days of their little tenth century glory,
and trusted increasingly in their god as their salvation. National
hopes fell and divine ones rose; until the Hebrew people passed
from thinking of the Lord as all powerful to thinking of him
as one and sole: monotheism had evolved out of monolatry as
this had grown out of a special tribal cult. Historically the
monotheistic idea was not new. Ikhnaton of Egypt had proclaimed
it more than half a thousand years before the Hebrew
prophets. The concept may actually have been carried over;
but it certainly drew sustenance of its own on Hebrew soil and
first became established there as a cardinal, enduring element
of a national civilization. The Hebrews adhered to monotheism
with an ever-increasing insistence; until the concept was taken
over by Christianity and Islam—two of the three great international
religions; Buddhism, the third, being essentially atheistic.
Here then is another tremendously spread cultural element
of deep significance that originated as a local west Asiatic
variant.</p>

<h3 id="section248">248. <span class="smcap">Other Contributing Nationalities</span></h3>

<p>Almost every people in the area, in fact, made its special
contribution. In Asia Minor evolved the concept of a great
primal mother goddess, known to the Greeks as Cybele. Lydia,
in western Asia Minor, coined the earliest money about 700
B.C. Some people near the Black Sea in eastern Asia Minor
seem to have been the first to develop the working of iron and
perhaps of steel. The Kassites from the north or east probably
introduced the horse into Babylonia, soon after 2000 B.C.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456"></a>[456]</span>
Thence it spread, as the animal of royalty, aristocracy, and the
special arm of chariot warfare, until it reached Egypt some
three hundred years later. The first domestication of the horse
was apparently in central Asia; the transmission to Europe may
have been direct rather than through Mediterranean Asia. The
camel had been tamed earlier, also in central Asia. Its remains
appear in Turkistan in the copper period; and in Israel the
Arab Midianite raiders whom Gideon defeated rode camels,
while some generations later, in David’s time, about 1000 B.C.,
horses were still scarce.</p>

<h3 id="section249">249. <span class="smcap">Ægean Civilization</span></h3>

<p>On the island of Crete, almost equidistant from Asia, Africa,
and Europe, there began to grow up with the introduction of
bronze, about 3000 B.C., a civilization most of whose elements
were imported, but which added to them and molded the whole
of its mass with unusual originality. Three great periods, named
the Early, Middle, and Late “Minoan” after the legendary
Cretan king Minos, are distinguishable in the abundant remains
which excavation has brought to light; each of these is divisible
into three sub-periods designated I, II, III. At some sites, such
as Knossos, the remains of successive sub-periods are separated
by layers of packed-down earth deposited when an old settlement
was obliterated and serving as floor for the next occupation.
Underneath the Bronze Age deposits were thick strata
from the Neolithic, with unpainted pottery. With the Early
Minoan, about 3000 B.C., painted pottery as well as bronze
came in, to be followed by the potter’s wheel and a system of
hieroglyphic writing unrelated to the Egyptian. In the Middle
Minoan the pottery became polychrome, palaces were built, art
took a remarkable naturalistic turn in pottery and fresco painting
and carving, and the hieroglyphics evolved into a linear,
probably syllabic, script. The beginning of the Late Minoan,
from the sixteenth to the fourteenth century B.C., saw the culmination
of Cretan civilization. Then something violent happened,
the palaces were destroyed, and after a brief decadence
Minoan culture passed out at the arrival of the first of the historic
Greeks, at the opening of the Iron Age, about 1250 B.C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457"></a>[457]</span></p>

<p>The Minoans left no chronology of their own and their writing
is unread. But datable Egyptian objects found in Cretan strata
of identified period, and Cretan objects characteristic of particular
periods found at datable Egyptian sites as the result of
trade, have made possible an indirect but positive chronology
for Minoan culture. The second sub-periods of Early, Middle,
and Late Minoan respectively were contemporary with the
Sixth, Twelfth, and Eighteenth Dynasties on the Nile. From
2000 B.C. on, Minoan dates are therefore reliable within a century
and sometimes less. Industry, commerce, games, a light,
practical style of architecture, above all a graceful realistic art,
flourished particularly from Middle Minoan III to Late Minoan
II. There was evidently considerable wealth, a leisure class,
and life was prevailingly peaceful and surrounded with charm.</p>

<p>The Minoans were a Caucasian people of Mediterranean race.
Their language is unknown, but seems to have been distinct from
the later Greek, and therefore probably non-Indo-European.
When their home power crumbled, a fragment appears to have
taken refuge in Asia and founded the Philistine cities which
for a time pressed the tribal Hebrews and which gave their
name to Palestine.</p>

<p>A related culture appears in the ruins of the successive cities
of Troy; on the islands of the Ægean Sea; and in mainland
Greece, where it has been called Mycenæan, after the citadel and
town attributed to Agamemnon. Ægean perhaps is the name
least likely to confuse, for this larger culture of which the Cretan
Minoan was long the most illustrious representative. The <a href="#table3">table</a>
outlines the principal correlations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458"></a>[458]</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459"></a>[459]</span></p>

<p>The thirteenth century brought the Greeks, then a rude,
hardy, and at first non-maritime people, fighting their way south
and wrecking or sapping the Ægean civilization. Culture lost
its bloom, life became hard, the outlook contracted. Art shriveled
into crude geometric ornamentation, the forms became
childishly inept, intercourse with the Orient sank to a minimum,
and when trade and foreign stimulation revived they were at
first in Phœnician hands. It is not until the seventh century
that true history begins in Greece, and in the main only to the
sixth that the rudiments of that characteristic Hellenic philosophy,
literature, and art can be traced, which were released
after the Persian wars early in the fifth century. Yet the half
thousand and more years of dark ages between Ægean and
classic Greek civilization did not entail a complete interruption.
The Greek often enough smote the Mycenæan or Minoan. More
often, perhaps, he settled alongside him, possibly oppressed him,
but learned from him. He choked out Ægean culture, but
nourished his own upon it. The Homeric poems, composed in
Greek during this period of retrogression, picture a civilization
essentially Ægean; and along with them much other cultural
tradition must have been passed on.</p>

<p>At any rate, when Greek culture reëmerged, it was charged
with Oriental elements and influences, but perhaps even more
charged with Ægean ones. Its games, its unponderous architecture,
its open city life, the free quality of its art, its political
particularity, its peculiar alert tenseness and feeling for grace,
had all flourished before on Greek soil. Their flavor is un-Asiatic
and un-Egyptian of whatever period. We have here
another instance of the tenacity of the attachment of cultural
qualities to the soil; of the faculty, at once absorptive and resistive,
that for thousands of years, however inventions might
diffuse and culture elements circulate, succeeded in keeping
China something that can fairly be called Chinese, India Indian,
Egypt Egyptian, the Northwest and Southwest of America
Northwestern and Southwestern respectively; in a degree even
kept Europe, so long culturally dependent on the Orient, always
European.</p>

<h3 id="section250">250. <span class="smcap">Europe</span></h3>

<p>With Greece we have entered the realm of what is conventionally
regarded as history. For the rest of Europe, prehistoric
archæology and its record of illiterate peoples abut so closely
on history in the ordinary sense, that a tracing of the transition
takes one promptly into documentary study. There is much in
this early historical field that is of anthropological interest, and
just back of it lies more that is specifically so: where the round
headed peoples came from who began to appear in Europe during
the Neolithic; whether peoples like Ligurians, Sicilians,
Scythians, were Indo-Europeans or not, and of what branch;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460"></a>[460]</span>
where the blond Nordic type took shape and whether it originally
spoke dialects of the Germanic group; who built Stonehenge
and the other megalithic monuments of western Europe;
where the first home of the Indo-Europeans lay. But such
problems are intricate, and usually answerable, if at all, from
stray indications scattered among masses of literary and historical
data controllable only by the specialist, whose primary
interests tend in other directions. Where these documented
indications fail, the problems become speculative. We have no
clear record of any indubitable Indo-European people, in or out
of Europe, before the second millenium B.C. When they appear
in history, they are already differentiated into their familiar
main divisions. The Bronze Age Scandinavians seem likely to
have been Indo-Europeans and perhaps of the Germanic
branch; for the Neolithic an identification would be mere guessing.
The LaTène Iron culture is characteristically Keltic, that
of the Hallstadt period and area less certainly Illyrian and
Keltic. And after all, such considerations concern speech, or
race, which can be associated with any culture. Our present
concern being primarily with the latter, it will be more profitable
to pass on from these questions and turn to regions remote
from those in which Occidental civilization assumed its modern
form.</p>

<h3 id="section251">251. <span class="smcap">China</span></h3>

<p>China, far from Europe and known to the outside world only
recently, possesses a civilization so different from ours in a
multitude of aspects, that thought of connection between the
cultures seems at first unreasonable. One thinks of rice, pagodas,
bound feet, queues, silk, tea, ancestor worship, a strange, chopped,
singing speech, and writing in still stranger characters. Yet
the Chinese have long had a civilization identical in many of
its constituents with our own: civil government, rimed poetry,
painting, trousers, wheat and barley, our common domestic animals,
bronze and iron, for instance. Since most of these culture
elements are wanting in Africa and Oceania, as well as in native
America, there is no inherent reason why they should be expectable
in China. Their repetition in China and in the West<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461"></a>[461]</span>
as the result of independent causes would be remarkable. Evidently
many if not all of this group of common traits represent
absorptions into the civilization of China, or diffusions out of
it into the West, much as the larger part of early European
civilization was imported out of the nearer Orient.</p>

<p>In the broader perspective of culture history, then, China no
longer stands aloof. The roots of her civilization are largely the
same as those of our own. In this light, understanding of Chinese
civilization involves two steps. The first is the tracing of
the elements derived from the west or imparted to it. The
second is the recognition of how these were remodeled and combined
with elements of local growth and thereby given their
peculiarly Chinese cast and setting.</p>

<p>Authentic historical records of China go back only three thousand
years, and her archæology is little known. Beyond the
beginning of the Chou dynasty, about 1100 B.C., or more exactly,
beyond a point when this dynasty was about three centuries old,
in 827 B.C., the Chinese possess only legendary history, in which
slight strands of fact are interwoven with fabricated or fabulous
constituents. Then, too, the Chinese have long been genuinely
more advanced than their neighbors, than all of their world, in
fact; with the result that they could hardly escape the conviction
of their own superiority and self-sufficiency, and the belief
that they had devised almost everything in their own culture.
This presumption led to the conscientious manufacture by native
historians of dates for inventions which were really made
outside of China.</p>

<p>Beginning, then, in the ninth century B.C., we find the Chinese
a settled and populous people in the lower valley of the
great Yellow river, in what is now the northeastern corner of
the “Eighteen Provinces” or China proper, from about Si-an-fu
to Peking. They may have come from middle Asia or still
farther west by a national migration, as has sometimes been conjectured:
there is nothing to show that they did, and a great
deal to suggest that they had lived in or near their seats of that
period long before. It is difficult to imagine that the Chinese
could have moved out of central Asia without leaving a part
of their number behind, or without leaving conspicuous traces
of their culture among their former neighbors. Of this there is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462"></a>[462]</span>
no evidence. For one of the most advanced peoples of its time
to remove itself and its civilization complete and unimpaired
would be without parallel in history, and indeed is inconceivable
as soon as one turns from the vague idea to face specific details
of the process.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Chinese as we first know them had the principal
grains and tamed animals, the metals and plow and wheel
of contemporary Eastern Asia and Europe. While it is scarcely
thinkable that this great complex of culture traits should not
have been due to connections with the west, there is every probability
that these connections were of the sort that have been
traced so frequently in foregoing pages: diffusions unaccompanied
by populational drifts, or at least in the main independent
of them. When it is recalled that western Turkistan
held cereal-growing and animal-raising inhabitants far back in
the Neolithic, and that the Bronze period is definitely represented
in Siberia,<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> such transmission will not seem far fetched.
It is also well to remember that all through the historic period
central Asia contained farming populations, cities, traders, and
skilled artisans, some measure of which evidences of higher culture
it is only necessary to project a few thousand years backward
to complete the link in the cultural chain between China
and the west. We tend to overlook this fact because it is the
transient Hun and Mongol invasions that chiefly obtrude into
both western and Chinese history. Whenever the nomads ceased
boiling over, they receded from the historians’ view. Obviously
they could not have migrated and fought and burnt and slain
among each other continuously. The more settled life at home,
which they led most of the time, and into which they were
always inclined to take over the religion, writing, and arts of
the Orient, India and China, is the phase of their existence
most likely to be overlooked, but which, from the point of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463"></a>[463]</span>
view of the history of civilization, is far more important than
their evanescent conquests. In this underlying phase they were
the connectors of Near and Far East.</p>

<p>It is interesting in this connection that so far as more recent
transmissions between China and the west are datable or positively
traceable, they took place chiefly by the long land route
through central Asia. The first trade between the Roman empire
and China of the Han dynasty was overland; so was the
introduction of Buddhism and cotton from India. In each case
sea communication came later. It was scarcely before Mohammedan
times that ocean trade between China and the west became
important.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Chinese and other east Asiatics always
lacked, and still lack, several aspects of the grain-cattle-horse-wheel-metals
cluster that are very ancient and practically universal
in Europe, the Near East, and even central Asia. They
do not use milk or its products, wool, nor bread-leaven. It has
been suggested that the cluster was transmitted to China before
these traits had been added to it; and that when they finally
might have reached China, they found its people satisfactorily
established in a culture containing substitutes for these traits,
and therefore resistive to them.</p>

<p>It is significant that even to-day northern China, within which
the oldest known China lay, still cultivates wheat, barley, and
millet, and breeds cattle, horses, sheep, goats, and swine, as did
the Swiss lake-dwellers; whereas in southern China the typical
grain and animal are rice and the buffalo, as in Indo-China and
Malaysia. There are evidently two fundamentally distinct economic
systems here, characteristic respectively of Europe and
west and north Asia, and of southeastern Asia; and evolving
in the main independently. The first civilized China, that of
the Chou period, that which produced Confucius as its literary
standardizer, and has chiefly shaped Chinese traditions and institutions
ever since, belonged to the great northern and western
cycle; was in fact its easternmost outpost.</p>

<p>This brings up the question whether Chinese writing could
not also have sprung from a western source, notably the
Sumerian Cuneiform, which it superficially resembles in its
linear, non-pictorial strokes, and in its mixed ideographic-phonetic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464"></a>[464]</span>
method. The connection has indeed been asserted, but
no satisfactory evidence of specific correspondences has been
adduced. The most that it seems valid to maintain is that a
remote connection is thinkable; a connection not extending
beyond a limited number of characters or the idea or method
of writing. The earliest Chinese characters preserved on bronzes
are nearly two thousand years younger than the most ancient
inscriptions of the system which developed into the classic
Cuneiform. Both systems are fairly crystallized when they first
come to our knowledge. Their formative stages, in which such
connection as they might have would be most apparent, are obscure.
It is well to remember that Cuneiform and Egyptian
hieroglyphic, which were virtually contemporaneous and much
nearer to each other geographically, have not yet been brought
into specific relation as regards their origins.</p>

<h3 id="section252">252. <span class="smcap">Growth and Spread of Chinese Civilization</span></h3>

<p>Chou China at first embraced most of Shensi and Honan,
southern Shansi and Chihli, and western Shantung. It was
feudal, and practically as separatist as mediæval Germany. The
chief functions of the over-king were to perform sacrifices, to
admonish the kings and princes, and to govern his small dynastic
domain. Unity lay not so much in an effective organization as
in an idea, the feeling of a common race and especially of a
common civilization. This idea has persisted to the present.
It is adhesion to the culture of China, to its deep roots, its permanence,
its humanities, that has always made Chinamen feel
themselves Chinamen; has in fact sooner or later turned into
Chinamen all alien elements, whether they were intrusive conquerors
or primitive folk, that came to be included within the
limits of the realm. In this way common customs and ideals
already united the dozen or more larger Chou states and hundreds
of dependencies; and chronic internal warfare did not
prevent this era from being the age of Confucius, Laotse, Mencius
and the other great sages that from the sixth to the fourth
centuries formulated the typical Chinese character and attitude.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the Chou period began a gradual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465"></a>[465]</span>
reduction of the number of feudal states, due to the larger
swallowing the smaller. By the middle of the third century,
two of these had emerged as preponderant: Ts’in in the west,
centering about the Wei valley, and Ch’u on the south, along
the middle Yangtse. Both were frontier states, less cultivated
and hardier than the others, and regarded as barbarian or only
half Chinese. Ts’in may have included some Hunnish absorptions;
Ch’u very likely represented the rule of a Chinese
dynasty over a native population whose original affiliations may
have been either with the non-Sinitic Anamese of to-day, with
the Shan-Siamese division, or with some closer branch of the
Sinitic family, but who were gradually assimilating the culture
and speech of the northern old China. At last, in 223 B.C.,
Ch’u fell before Ts’in, and within two years the remaining
states in the northeast collapsed. For the first time China,
from nearly its present frontier to south of the Yangtse, was
effectively under one active ruler, Shi Hwang-ti, the “first
emperor.” His dynasty crumbled almost at his death, but only
to be succeeded by the famous Han line, under which, in the
two centuries before and the two after Christ, China extended,
consolidated, and prospered. The boundaries of the empire
were pushed, in name at least, to virtually their present limits;
and though political control may often have been slight, cultural
influence progressed rapidly south of the Yangtse, much
as Gaul became Romanized at the same time. Even the survival
of half-independent barbarian groups here and there in the
south and west has its parallel in the persistence of Keltic speech
in French Brittany. By the seventh to ninth centuries after
Christ, when the empire flourished once more under the Tang
dynasty, the mass of southern China may be considered to have
been substantially assimilated. Even the southern coast, which
was the last area to be integrated, and which retains to-day
the greatest dialectic differentiations and autonomous tendencies,
had become part of the Chinese polity and civilization.
The consequence was that when in the thirteenth century the
Mongols and in the seventeenth the Manchus conquered the
empire, they accomplished little more than the overthrow of one
dynasty by another. The course of Chinese culture went on
undisturbed, as it had in several previous historic periods when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_466"></a>[466]</span>
half of the realm passed temporarily under the sway of nomads
or barbarians from the north.</p>

<p>A considerable measure of the cultural predominance of China
over her neighbors is to be ascribed to her more numerous population,
which in turn was partly due to the cultural advance.
The Chinese were the first nation to maintain a system of fairly
reliable census records. In the first century and a half after
Christ, under the Hans, ten censuses showed from 29 to 83 million
inhabitants, the average being 63 millions, or about the same
as the estimated population of the Roman empire at its height;
somewhat more than that of Europe when America was discovered.
A thousand years later, between 1021 and 1580, eight
censuses yielded from 43 to 100 millions, with an average of 62
millions. Under the Manchus the population gradually rose
from 125 millions in 1736 to 380 in 1881. To-day, the northern
half of China is about twice as populous as the southern, and
the eastern half exceeds the western in the same ratio. This
superior density of population in the northeast reflects the fact
that ancient China was the northeast. The same grounding in
the past is evident in the fact that from the time of the Chous
until the Mongol conquest in 1268, the imperial capitals lay
mainly in Shensi or Honan, the core of the old kingdom.</p>

<p>Many ingredients of modern Chinese civilization, and most of
its distinctive color, have been present in it since the opening
of the historic period. Such are the use of hemp and silk as
the typical textile materials; of jade as the precious stone of the
nation; the tremendous, life-long moral authority accorded to
parents, and the associated worship of ancestors; the unusual
respect and rewards for learning; a professed contempt for war
and emotional activity; aversion for mythological and metaphysical,
scientific, or any other sort of speculation, and coupled
therewith an unflagging interest in practical ethics, in the cultivation
of character, in the finer shaping of the relations of individuals.
These and other leanings endow Chinese civilization
with something persistently idiomatic, with a quality of coherent
originality. If this civilization were less great, China and the
countries influenced by it would be spoken of as constituting
what among barbarous and savage peoples we call a culture-area.
In the widest perspective, they are such. China, India,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467"></a>[467]</span>
the West—which in this view of course includes the Near East
as well as Europe—are the three great focal centers of civilization
in the eastern hemisphere. Their cultures have risen far
above those of the intervening and peripheral nations. Until
quite recent centuries, the three have run their courses with
approximately equal achievement. And while exchanging elements
since prehistoric times, they have each molded both what
they borrowed and what they devised into a unified and distinctive
design, have stamped it with original patterns. In short,
culture development in China, India, and the Occident has been
coördinate.</p>

<p>Of course, this distinctness of the three great regions of Old
World civilization does not imply that diffusion of culture elements
between them ever ceased. It is the form more than the
content of civilization that is peculiar to the three areas. From
India, for instance, China derived Buddhism, which was accorded
a reception under the Hans and cultivated with fervor
in the following centuries. Cotton came in the wake of the
religion—first as a rare and valuable textile, then to be grown.
The West, within the historic period, gave glass and perhaps the
impulse toward a Chinese “invention”—porcelain, a glazed-through
pottery. In recent centuries the West acted as transmitter
for several elements of American origin, tobacco, for
example, and maize, which quickly became an important food-plant
in parts of China. There have even been reimportations.
Gunpowder is said to have been used for fireworks in China in
the fifth century, for war in the twelfth, but its employment for
the propulsion of missiles from firearms is due to introduction
by the Altaic nations in the fifteenth century. From the fourth
century B.C. on, there are repeated references in Chinese sources
to the magnetic needle and to “south-pointing chariots”—apparently
a compass-like device used on land, though probably
only as a mechanical toy. Then the needle was applied to
geomantic purposes, until Arab or other foreign sailors took it
up as a true mariner’s compass, and in the eleventh or twelfth
century reintroduced it to the Chinese as an instrument of
navigation.</p>

<p>Nor was civilization as stagnant in China as the outsider is
likely to think, who becomes aware first of all of its persistent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468"></a>[468]</span>
native flavor. The old war chariot, for instance, went out of
use about contemporaneously in China and the West. Printing
from engraved blocks was in vogue in the sixth century after
Christ, from movable clay types in the dynasties between the
Tangs and the Mongols, from metal types not much later, since
the art was established among the imitating Koreans in the
fifteenth century. A system of classifying the numerous characters
was invented before the Tangs; the modern one of grouping
them according to 214 radicals, under the Mings. True
encyclopædias were first compiled in the fourteenth century—four
hundred years earlier than in the West. The system of
awarding office on the basis of literary examinations took root
under the Hans and became organized under the Tangs. The
earliest poetry, three thousand years ago, was rimed, and had
four or five monosyllabic words in the line. In the Tang time,
the line became extended to seven words; and still later was
the origin of the peculiar rhythm of alternating tones—a system
by which every other word was one bearing the “even” tone
and those between any of the other tones. Paper making is said
to date from the Hans, and paper money was first issued—disastrously
as in some of the first Western attempts—under the
Mongols. These and dozens of other instances that might be
compiled exemplify, as does the history of ancient Egypt, that
even those cultures constantly move to which one is tempted to
apply the stigma “conservative” or “tradition-bound.”</p>

<h3 id="section253">253. <span class="smcap">The Lolos</span></h3>

<p>Scattered in the mountains of southern and western China are
a number of barbarous, semi-independent peoples of distinctive
ways and speech who maintain their national or tribal status.
They seem on first contact to promise a picture of the pre-Chinese
culture of the area, but examination shows their customs
to be a blend of primitive and advanced, ancient and
recent elements. The Lolos of Szechuan may serve as an
example. They eat meat from their herds, use no milk, but
wear woolen clothing. They grow neither cotton nor rice.
They raise oats, buckwheat, maize, and potatoes. Two of these
plants are of north or west Asiatic origin; the others are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469"></a>[469]</span>
American. Plows are used. Houses are of lashed bamboos, and
rain-coats of palm-fiber. No pottery is made, but iron is worked
into weapons and tools by native smiths. The Lolos are warlike.
They fight like Malaysians with lance and sword. They
are organized “feudally,” into nobility and commoners, with
tribal heads or lords. They marry cousins. Religion resembles
that of the more backward Indo-Chinese and Malaysian peoples.
Sorcerer-priests cure disease; sacrifice animals for their blood,
the flesh being eaten; offer also fermented liquor; divine the
future by observing parts of the sacrificed animals—the cracks
that develop in heated shoulder-blades (§ <a href="#section97">97</a>). There is a native
system of writing, which seems to derive from Chinese stimulus,
if not sources. It is obvious that this culture has fused together
very old elements that are characteristic of southeastern Asia,
with elements that have flowed in from remote sources or during
the most recent centuries. It is also clear that certain ingredients
of Chinese culture have been freely absorbed and others
rejected by this mountain people.</p>

<p>Such cultures as that of the Lolos may be described as internally
marginal or peripheral. They differ from externally
marginal cultures, like those of the Bushmen, Australians,
Fuegians, in that the latter, on account of their geographical
remoteness, have retained their ancient level with relative
purity. Included marginal cultures, on the contrary, being
of necessity exposed to subsequent influences, are regularly a
mixture of belated and recent ingredients, no matter how well
integrated these may have become.</p>

<h3 id="section254">254. <span class="smcap">Korea</span></h3>

<p>Korea has repeatedly been under the political authority of
China, more often autonomous, but for three thousand years has
been dependent on China culturally. Non-Chinese influences
have also reached it: such as an alphabet of Indian origin
(§ <a href="#section149">149</a>); and probably the earliest iron industry came in from
Altaic sources. In its turn, the peninsula transmitted to
Japan: until about a thousand years ago, Chinese writing and
culture reached Japan mainly via Korea. The spread of Chinese
civilization was perhaps largely of the usual, slow, diffusing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470"></a>[470]</span>
kind, but was several times accelerated by the settlement in
Korea of groups of Chinese refugees, colonists, or adventurers;
for instance in Chou and Han times. The center of power and
civilization within Korea has gradually moved southwards, which
suggests the waning of original central Asiatic affiliations as
Chinese ones became stronger. The first realm to be defined
was Fuyu on the Sungari river. Then followed Kokorai or
Korai, whence our name Korea. In the centuries immediately
before and after Christ, Shinra and then Hiaksai, farther south
on the peninsula, came into the lead. By the beginning of this
period not only the writing but the classic books of China had
been introduced. Since the fourteenth century Confucianism
has been the state religion—though the people had long before
become Buddhists—and literary examinations for office of the
Chinese type have been in vogue.</p>

<h3 id="section255">255. <span class="smcap">Japan</span></h3>

<p>Japan is the one country of eastern Asia from which considerable
prehistoric data are available. There are indeed no indubitable
evidences of any Palæolithic culture or race, but shellheaps
and burial mounds abound and have been explored. The
shell deposits, of which 4,000 have been found, are probably
the accumulation of refuse of occupation by the Ainu, the first
known inhabitants of Japan, now surviving only in the extreme
north of the island chain and in Sakhalien, and still a primitive
people. This race is different from the Japanese, and has often
been classified as Caucasian (§ <a href="#section27">27</a>). The shell deposits show the
aborigines to have been fishers and hunters, without agriculture
or edible domestic animals. They had the bow, dog, incised
hand-made pottery, and ground stone axes, and were thus approximately
in an early Neolithic stage.</p>

<p>A somewhat dubious bronze age is sparsely represented in
southern Japan. It has been ascribed to an invasion about the
seventh century B.C., but is perhaps only an early phase of the
iron age. Iron was brought in at a time not precisely determined,
but likely to have been about the fourth century B.C.,
by the so-called Yamato people—evidently the ancestors of the
Japanese of to-day—who seem to have come from Korea and at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471"></a>[471]</span>
any rate occupied the southern islands first. Thence they fought
their way northward, gaining territory at the expense of the
natives but slowly. Fifteen centuries ago the northern third
of the main island was still in Ainu possession. These early
Japanese erected megalithic chambers or corridors as tombs for
their princes, covering them with mounds of earth. More than
3,000 of these structures are known. The early emperors were
buried in double mounds, some of them of great area. From
the fifth to the seventh century Korean influence was strong;
the Chinese writing and classics were imported from that country.
Later relations between the two nations were more intermittent,
perhaps because of the growing consolidation and
strength of Japan from the eighth century on.</p>

<p>The cultural debt of Japan to China is great, but less than
that of Korea. The Japanese added 47 purely phonetic syllabic
characters to the Chinese writing, in order to represent their
own proper names, grammatical forms, and the like. These characters
would have sufficed for a simple, efficient, and purely
native script, but have remained a mere supplement to the ideographic
Chinese system (§ <a href="#section105">105</a>). The mandarin and examination
system of China were never taken over by the Japanese,
who clung to their feudal customs more than two thousand years
later than China. The ancestor worship of the Chinese and the
official Confucian religion also did not become established in
Japan, the state cult being Shinto, the crystallization of a primitive
set of rites and of a mythology which has parallels in the
Occident, in the East Indies and Oceania, and even in North
America, rather than in China.</p>

<p>An early Malaysian strain in both Japanese race and culture
has been alleged, but this is a subject on which more evidence
is needed. Japanese speech does not elucidate the origins of
the nation, the language—like that of Korea—not being determined
as related to any other. The physical type, on the other
hand, and this applies also to Korea, is allied to that of China.</p>

<h3 id="section256">256. <span class="smcap">Central and Northern Asia</span></h3>

<p>It has become a habit to regard central and northern Asia as
a hive for humanity, as the area from which nations and races<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472"></a>[472]</span>
have chronically swarmed. Whenever the origin of a people
remains obscure, be they Neandertals, Alpines, Sumerians, Chinese,
Japanese, Aryans, or what not, some one propounds the
convenient hypothesis of deriving them from this vast interior
land, which in many cases amounts to an explanation of the
half-known by the unknown. Of late there has been added the
fashion of attributing the expansions to climatic drying-up of
central Asia, which forced the population out. There appears
to be considerable evidence of such progressive desiccation; but
its degree, and still more the extent of its influence upon culture
and emigration, remain to be ascertained.</p>

<p>A more balanced view would concede the recurrence and
occasional destructiveness of the invasions out of central Asia,
but would view them rather as transient and relatively superficial
phenomena from the point of view of civilization; and on
the other hand would recognize that under all the boiling of
tribes and peoples, the growth and spread of culture went
steadily on, even in the tracts which one is wont to associate
only with the perpetual breeding of elusive and devastating
nomads. In short, it is wise to guard against a natural overestimation
of the sensational, cataclysmic aspects of the history
of the interior Asiatic peoples. It is their spasmodic irruptions
which the self-centered nations of the West, of India, and of
China, have been chiefly concerned with. Their attempts at
achieving stability, their increments to the world’s culture, their
rôle as peaceful transmitters, have lain at home, largely out of
vision of the peoples clustered about the foci of civilization.</p>

<p>It may be added that the temptation to the outsider to burst
by force into the seats of wealth and splendor as soon as firmness
of guard slackens, is not confined to Ural-Altaians, but is
ever present in history. Amorites, Hebrews, Arabs, Æthiopians,
Lybians, Greeks, Kelts, Germans, Hindus, and Malays have all
played this part at one time or another. Semite, Hamite, and
Aryan are no different in such regard from Ural-Altaian, except
that in the short span conventionally known as history the
former have happened more often to be the ins and haves, the
central Asiatics the outs and have-nots. Further, the destructive
effect of nomad migrations, even where accompanied by
mass settlement of population, is everywhere transient so far<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473"></a>[473]</span>
as civilization is concerned. Hebrew and Hellenic, Arab and
Germanic tribes did crash cities and empires before them, but
they tore down only what was already moribund, and brought
in new systems of thought, new methods of feeling and organization,
which, however crude at first, soon added new qualities
to culture. The chief distinction of the north Asiatics is that,
excepting some terror-striking massacres, they were both less
subversive and less constructive culturally than Semites and
Indo-Europeans. They barely dented the civilization of the
West as they barely dented that of India and China. If Russia
is backward as compared with western Europe, it is not from
having been Tatar-ruled a few centuries, but because Russia
has long been peripheral to the Mediterranean focus of civilization
and therefore chronically belated. It was the very thinness
of her culture that made mediæval Russia succumb to the
Mongol wave which pounded vainly against the more consolidated
civilization of central Europe and quickly drew off.</p>

<p>To define the exact contribution of the North Asiatics to civilization
is difficult: partly because of the comparative paucity
of available archæological and historical records; partly because
their habitat did not contain one of the greater hearths of civilization
at which its most distinctive forms were sweated out.
The area has always been relatively though not extremely
peripheral. The horse, indeed, can be set down as one important
gift of the Ural-Altaic peoples or their predecessors to general
civilization. It is only in central Asia that a wild horse—not
a tame breed that has run wild—is to be found; and it
seems to have been from the north that soon after 2000 B.C. the
animal was introduced into Mesopotamia and India. Biological
considerations also point to interior Asia as the most likely area
of first domestication of several of the earlier fundamental animals
of culture, especially the sheep and goat. The comparatively
advanced culture of Anau in Turkistan in the Neolithic
and early Bronze periods is also significant, even though this
site lies only just within the great steppe and plateau country.
Some of the jade and jade-like stone used for tools and ornaments
in the Swiss lake-dwellings appears to have come from
inner Turkistan. The probability of the central Asiatic peoples
having been the transmitters of metals, cattle, grains and other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_474"></a>[474]</span>
important groups of culture elements from the Near to the Far
East has already been mentioned, as has the established trade
between China and the Mediterranean world in Roman times
(§ <a href="#section251">251</a>). Indeed the very character of the country and cultural
conditions which favored a considerable degree, though not an
absolute prevalence, of nomadism in interior Asia, seem also to
have fostered, in many periods, a longer range of trade than
flourished elsewhere. Finally, it appears that the Turks and
Mongols had at least a hand in the early use of gunpowder for
firearms; and, as already mentioned, the first state paper money,
that of China, was issued by a Mongol dynasty. It is scarcely
rash to predict that the intensive study of the interior Asiatic
peoples from both prehistoric and historic sources, without
speculative bias or plunging of opinion, will prove one of the
most illuminating contributions to the history of general civilization.</p>

<p>The original unity of the Ural-Altaians—with the Turks,
Mongols, and Tungus-Manchu as the Altaic or definitely
Asiatic group, Finno-Ugrians as Uralic or Eurasian, and
Samoyeds as specifically Arctic representatives—is accepted on
linguistic grounds by almost all authorities in the field. Yet
the career of the several divisions has been diverse. The
Finno-Ugrians have mainly been peaceful: the Finns definitely
so for two thousand years: the Hungarian Magyars were exceptional
when they terrorized central Europe a thousand years
ago. Both these nations have long since become integrally absorbed
into European culture. They are the only Ural-Altaic
peoples with this experience. The remainder of the Finno-Ugrians
have for some centuries become increasingly submerged
under Russian civilization; much as in the Far East the Manchu-Tungus
have gradually fallen more and more under either Chinese
or, of late, Russian cultural influence. As between the
Turks and Mongols, the greatest single conquest, that of
Djengis Khan and his successors, falls to the record of the
latter; but the Turks have been the more numerous, stable, and
advanced people. They have frequently settled as well as invaded;
and are the only known stock, as previously mentioned
(§ <a href="#section245">245</a>), that has ever seriously and permanently encroached on
territory once held by Indo-Europeans—in Asia Minor and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475"></a>[475]</span>
Caspian region. The later so-called Mongol conquests, those of
Tamerlane and the Indian Moguls, were made by armies mainly
of Turks under dynasties tracing back to former Mongol leaders.
The Turks in general have inclined to Mohammedanism on coming
into contact with the world religions, the Mongols to Buddhism,
although Christianity in its Nestorian form once made
considerable numbers of converts among both.</p>

<p>Several important historic peoples cannot yet be assigned with
certainty to one or the other of the Ural-Altaic divisions, or are
variously classified: thus the Huns, most likely to have been
Turks; the White Huns or Ephthalites; the Avars; and the
ancient Bulgars.</p>

<p>In northern and eastern Siberia there live, besides the
Samoyed, a series of non-Ural-Altaic peoples, truly peripheral
and retarded in culture, who seem once to have occupied larger
areas but to have shrunk or been partially absorbed before
Ural-Altaic expansion. These include the tribes sometimes
grouped as Yeniseian; the Yukaghir; the Kamchadal-Koryak-Chukchi
group; a few Eskimo who have either failed to cross
Behring strait or have come across it from America; and perhaps
the Ainu of Japan and Sakhalien. These have been called
the Palæo-Asiatic peoples, though their diverse languages render
their community of origin dubious. How far they may be considered
as following a positively similar culture, except in direct
response to an extreme climate, is also doubtful. Their rigorously
marginal position and depriving environment stamp their
culture with a preponderance of negative traits. The possession
of domesticated reindeer is common to several of these peoples
as well as to the Tungus and the Finno-Ugric Lapps of northern
Russia and Scandinavia. Reindeer-breeding among these groups
appears to be due to a transmission, in the sense of being a
reflex of contact, an imitation of the cattle or horse breeding
of the more favorably situated nations to the south. It is also
interesting and probably significant that the American Eskimos
never domesticated the reindeer, although they depended largely
upon its hunt.</p>

<p>Racially the array of north and central Asiatic peoples shades
from pronounced Caucasian to extreme Mongoloid type. The
Mongols have given name to their whole larger racial stock, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476"></a>[476]</span>
the Tungus-Manchu and northeast Siberian savages clearly
form part thereof. The Turks in the main are rather Caucasian,
although all intergradations occur according to region; as also
among the Finno-Ugrians. The Hungarians to-day are not only
Caucasians but Alpines; the Finns definite Nordics; the Lapps
a strange partial graft of Nordic traits on broad faced and
broad headed Mongolian physique.</p>

<h3 id="section257">257. <span class="smcap">India</span></h3>

<p>India is not a country, but a connected block of lands shut
off from the remainder of the world by lofty mountains and
harboring a population approximating those of Europe and of
China. Its 300,000,000 inhabitants constitute nearly a fifth of
humanity. Historically, India forms a continent as fully as
does Africa. Culturally, it must be equated with the Occidental
or Mediterranean area and with China as one of the three great
and substantially coördinate focal points which civilization developed
in the eastern hemisphere.</p>

<p>Racially the peoples of India are prevailingly Caucasian, but
both the two other great stocks are represented. Nearly everywhere,
but especially in the south, there is an evident admixture
of a dark skinned, broad nosed, long headed type. This is more
likely to have had Australoid than Negro affinities before its
absorption; remnants of it, like the Veddas of Ceylon and Irulas
and some other tribes of the Deccan, are often grouped with
more easterly peoples as representatives of an original Indo-Australoid
race (§ <a href="#section24">24</a>, <a href="#section27">27</a>, <a href="#section260">260</a>). So far as this race can be
reconstructed, it seems to have been less Negroid than the Australian
of to-day; that is, it possessed more Caucasian resemblances.
In fact, it might almost be described as proto-Caucasian.
In this light the modern Hindu<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> would be a varying
mixture of two related strains—the undifferentiated proto-Caucasian,
approximating the Australian and perhaps having
ultimate Negroid relations without being Negroid; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477"></a>[477]</span>
specialized Caucasian typical of the Occident; the former
strongest in the south, the latter almost pure in the northwest
of India. This hypothesis has this to commend it: it squares
with the facts that the Hindu in spite of his dark complexion
makes almost universally the impression of being essentially
“white” in race; and that he differs outstandingly from what
a mulatto-like blend of Negro and Caucasian would be.</p>

<p>In the north and east of India, Mongolian resemblances begin
to appear, as the natural result of thousands of years of contact
of two stocks.</p>

<p>It would seem that the proportions of racial blood in India,
and in the rough their geographical distribution, parallel the proportions
of the numbers of speakers of tongues belonging to the
several families. More than three-fourths of the Hindus speak
Indo-European dialects. Most of the remainder are Dravidas
in the south and Kolarians in the east central parts—the same
regions in which the Indo-Australoid or proto-Caucasian element
is most conspicuous. Along the northeastern edge, Tibeto-Burman
speech has spilled in with the Mongolian type. However,
while the races have blended, the languages have remained
distinct. As almost everywhere, the linguistic classification is
therefore clearer cut in India than the racial one. Consequently
it is misleading to infer from a Hindu’s speaking a Sanskrit-derived
language that his Caucasian blood is pure, or conversely
to conclude that all Dravidians have broad noses and black
skins.</p>

<p>The Kolarians have been thought by some to possess ancient
linguistic relatives to the east (§ <a href="#section50">50</a>), and certainly possess cultural
ones in this direction (§ <a href="#section262">262</a>). Dravidian speech has not
been thus connected, even tentatively, and one indication points
to its former westward extension: the Brahui language in
Beluchistan, which appears to be the remnant of an old
Dravidian offshoot.</p>

<p>The ancient culture of India is inadequately known. Archæological
exploration and analysis have been insufficient; yet they
have gone far enough to suggest that the prehistoric development
followed different lines from those in the West, so that
the findings of European prehistory cannot be applied to interpret
such knowledge as there is on India. Thus the Lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478"></a>[478]</span>
Palæolithic stage is well represented in India, but there is nothing
to show whether or not it was contemporaneous with that
of Europe. There is some possibility that it passed into the
Neolithic without the intervening Upper Palæolithic which is so
important in western Europe (§ <a href="#section213">213</a>). It seems dubious whether
there was a true Bronze Age in India. More pre-iron implements
of pure copper seem to have been found than of tin
bronze.</p>

<p>The early Kolarian culture seems preserved in considerable
degree among the modern Kolarians, who are backward hill or
forest tribes, that is, internally peripheral to the prevalent higher
civilization. At any rate, their culture resembles that of many
less advanced populations to the east, well out into Oceania.
This presumably ancient and partly surviving “Indo-Oceanic”
culture is discussed below (§ <a href="#section262">262</a>). As regards its history
within India, this is almost certain: the old culture is nowhere
any longer pure, but has regularly absorbed elements of the
advanced civilization that surrounds it; and conversely has contributed
to the latter. For instance, one of the great recognized
cults of India is Sivaism, which tends frequently to bloodiness
and obscenity and is a strange mixture of philosophical rationalization
and crass superstition. One of the most frequent
attributes of Siva is a necklace of skulls; a feature that looks
as if it might go back to the skull cult which is a typical ingredient
of Indo-Oceanic culture.</p>

<p>The old Dravidian culture was probably more advanced than
the Kolarian but is more difficult to reconstruct because of its
extensive blending with the culture brought in or developed by
Indo-Europeans. The Dravidians, perhaps because they were
the more advanced and populous, were able to accept the intrusive
culture and yet maintain themselves, whereas the Kolarians
either preserved themselves by resisting civilization or had their
speech and identity absorbed by it. When the Dravidians first
begin to creep into history, shortly before the Christian era,
they already possess cities, kingdoms, commerce, writing, and
philosophy. They have on the whole contributed less to Indian
civilization than the Indo-Europeans: its center always lay in
the north; but they have long formed an integral part of it.</p>

<p>The Indo-Europeans are first known to us from their religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479"></a>[479]</span>
hymns, the Vedas, which have been preserved as sacrosanct by
succeeding ages, and constitute the oldest continuously transmitted
documents in history. They date from 2000 or 1500 to
not after 1000 B.C., and are in Sanskrit, which is fairly close
to Avestan or Old Persian, the two languages and their descendants
constituting the Indo-Iranian or proper Aryan
branch of Indo-European. When Indo-European as a whole is
designated as Aryan, it is by an extension of the term. The
region of India to which the Vedas almost wholly refer is the
Indus drainage, that is the northwest, the parts adjoining the
Iranian highland, whence the invaders came or through which
they passed.</p>

<p>Vedic Aryan culture was of late Bronze Age type. Whether
the bronze was really such, or copper, it is mentioned more
frequently than iron, as in Homer and the older books of the
Bible. Grains, cattle, horses, chariots and wagons, the plow,
wool and weaving, gold, patriarchal chieftains and a tribal
society, a nature mythology, non-communal rituals with constant
but prevailingly bloodless sacrifices, are the characteristics
of this culture. It smacks more of the Europe of its time than
of the contemporary Orient. It is unbound, ready to pack up
and move without being essentially nomadic; half peasant-like
and half aristocratic; an uncitified semi-civilization, pioneer
rather than backwoods. The temples and writing, walled towns
and kingdoms, district gods and royal tombs of Egypt, Babylon,
Canaan, Minoan Greece are wanting. The picture is that of
the first historic Indo-Europeans elsewhere, in eastern and central
Europe; with whom the Aryans undoubtedly were or had
been in connection through the countries north of the Black
and Caspian seas.</p>

<p>A few centuries after the Vedas, the culture depicted by the
literary remains is profoundly altered. The scene has shifted
to the Ganges valley. There are cities and palaces, wealth and
pomp. There are kings, priests, townsmen, peasants, hermits
and ascetics. Caste is in vogue. Cotton and rice are in use.
There is a deal of philosophizing; life appears complex and difficult;
pessimism is abroad, soul rebirth taken for granted,
spirituality emphasized. Concepts to which western science
later returned, the atom and ether, are familiar. In all essentials,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480"></a>[480]</span>
post-Christian Hinduism had been blocked out in this pre-Christian
period. Only a few elements like money and writing
are lacking.</p>

<p>This change from the Vedic age is not fully accounted for,
and the time usually allowed for its occurrence is insufficient.
Buddha was born B.C. 563 or 557. His religion assumes ideas
which are part of the Sankhya philosophy—in many ways the
subtlest philosophy of all India and one of the great thought
systematizations of the world. Its founder Kapila is placed
about 600 B.C., and must have had predecessors. Caste seems
a thing of development. It is absent in the Vedas, but Buddhism
is already in a measure a protest against it. It seems difficult
to squeeze such growths into a few hundred years. It is true
that the florescence of Greece came with a rush; but Greek civilization
rose from the debris of the older Minoan one and was in
contact with the cultures of Asia. In India there is no sign of
an antecedent high civilization, and a greater dearth of known
foreign influences between 1000 and 600 B.C. than at any other
period. The transposition of the cultural center eastward must
enter into the problem. Perhaps a larger and wealthier pre-Aryan
population was encountered by the Aryans along the
Ganges, contact and mixture with whom proved provocative of
innovation. Or possibly the movement and development in the
east began while the Vedas were still being composed along the
Indus, and were ignored by them. Or, conceivably, the Aryans
on the Ganges may have been the first comers, who quickly
altered in the direction of their future civilization but remained
obscure to our vision during the period in which the Vedas
were being made or retained by the later comers of the Punjab,
in whose memories and sub-arid environment their former
steppe culture remained more unmodified. These are only
speculations: they emphasize the gap in our understanding of
this important chapter of world culture history.</p>

<h3 id="section258">258. <span class="smcap">Indian Caste and Religion</span></h3>

<p>Caste is peculiarly Indian. Nowhere else is it so complex, so
systematically worked out and endlessly reinforced by ritual
and taboo, so pervasive of conduct and thought. It has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481"></a>[481]</span>
ascribed to the conflict of races, to the drawing of a color line
by conquerors in order to keep their lineage and culture pure.
If so, it has failed egregiously, as the physical anthropology
of modern India shows. The explanation is obviously inadequate.
Castes do represent race to a certain extent, but they
also represent nationalities, tribes, common residence, religious
distinctness, occupations, cultural status. Whatever sets off a
group in any way may be sufficient to make it a caste in India.
If groups diverge within an established caste, they become recognized
as sub-castes, perhaps finally to develop into wholly
separate castes. Priests, nobles, clerks, fishermen, street-sweepers
are castes; so are the Parsis; so are hill tribes that
maintain their primitive customs—the Dravidian Todas for
instance are reckoned a high caste. Clearly we have here a
generic system, a pattern of organizing society, into which every
sort of group as it actually forms is fitted. Caste is a way of
thought which the Hindu has tried to universalize.</p>

<p>All Indian castes are in theory strictly endogamous: intermarriage
is intolerable. All possess an intrinsic, unchangeable
worth. Thus they automatically rank themselves. Each possesses
an occupation, a mode of life and customs, a set of prescribed
rituals, inherently peculiar to it. The greater the restrictions
and prohibitions incumbent upon it, the less it relaxes
to comfort and indifference, and the more spiritual it is, the
higher its grade. In consequence it is also the more pollutable,
and so its restrictions are drawn the closer. The wider the gap
of non-intercourse, of non-contact with lower castes, the greater
becomes its purity. Caste observance is thus a virtue, an aid to
religion and morality; breaking caste an ultimate indecency;
the offspring of inter-caste unions necessarily lower than either
parent, and their descendants, unless from matings with their
own miserable kind, lower still, in an infinitely descending series.
There is no elevating a caste. The very attempt to rise is a
vice that brings degradation as a result, since castes are eternal,
founded in nature, absolute, so that alteration is of necessity a
sullying.</p>

<p>Such is the Hindu scheme—which in actuality is lived up to
in no single point. Perverse as the system seems to men reared
in other cultures, it must be admitted to possess completeness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482"></a>[482]</span>
self-consistency, and the desire to preserve inward worth. It
differs from the basic assumptions of our civilization in that
it sees value as something already existing and therefore to be
maintained, not to be created; it tries to fit life into a theoretical
pattern; it is futureless. Yet all the facts show that as historical
realities castes have changed enormously and are changing
now. Obviously therefore each generation ignores the
changes last made and repeats its insistence on caste perpetuity
and unalterability. Such is the hold of patterns on men’s minds.</p>

<p>The theorizing which the Hindu does about caste is characteristic
of him in all cultural manifestations. The relation
which can be thought out between one fact or act and others, the
compartment to which it can be assigned in a system, are of
more interest to him, as compared with the fact itself, than to
peoples of other civilizations. Hence philosophy has flourished
in India, but native history has been inadequate and disorderly.
Hence too the abstract sciences of logic, mathematics, grammar
enjoyed an early original development, equal for a long time
and in part antecedent to that which they attained in the West.
On the other hand the astronomical and still more the physical
and biological sciences remained backward: they were concerned
with concrete objects. The Hindus seem never to have made
a move of their own toward devising a system of writing; but
once the Semitic alphabet had been introduced, they modified,
expanded, and rearranged it into a more logical scheme, a more
consistent one phonetically, than any other people has given it
(§ <a href="#section146">146</a>). It is probably no accident that chess and our “Arabic”
position numerals with a symbol for zero (§ <a href="#section109">109</a>) are Hindu
inventions, and that it is only in India that priests have for
age after age been ranked higher than rulers.</p>

<p>It is natural that a culture of such inclinations should exalt
the mind and soul above the body. Hence the extraordinary
development of asceticism in Indian religion; its deep pessimism
as regards life on this earth; its insistence on the superior
reality of soul, with which is connected the universal assumption
of rebirths; the working out of a system of unescapable
moral causality called <i>karma</i> in place of a scheme of mechanical
causation; the tendencies toward pantheistic identification of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483"></a>[483]</span>
soul and God, or atheistic denial of divinity as distinct from
soul; and the thoroughly anti-materialistic bent of almost all
Hindu philosophy. It is also intelligible that these qualities
should have imparted to Indian religion a superior degree of
spiritual intensity which was appreciated by the nations to the
north and east when Buddhism was presented to them, and
caused them to embrace it.</p>

<p>Like Christianity, however, Buddhism found no permanent
favor among the people and in the land of its origin. It flourished
in India for a time, but was rarely looked upon as more
than a sect; after something over a thousand years it died out
completely, except in Ceylon, at the very period that its hold
on non-Indian nations to the north and east was strengthening.
Its place was taken in India by the miscellaneous assemblage
of cults, all theoretically recognizing Brahman ascendancy, that
in the aggregate constitute what is known as Hinduism. Hinduism
is not a religion in the sense that Christianity, Mohammedanism,
Buddhism are “religions.” It recognizes no personal
founder, no head or establishment; it tends to exclude
foreigners rather than to convert them; it is national instead
of universal. It accepts and reinforces the existing institutions
of its particular culture: caste, for instance, which Buddhism
tried to transcend. Hinduism is therefore comparable to the
ancient Greek and early west Asiatic religions in consisting of
a series of locally or tribally different cults never integrated
or fully harmonized, conscious and tolerant of one another, resting
on common assumptions and similar in content, everywhere
in accord with tradition and usage, resistive to organization
into a larger whole but tied into a certain unity through reflecting
a more or less common civilization.</p>

<p>Hinduism is also comparable to Confucianism and Shintoism
with this difference. These grew up analogously, but early
became associated with the central government or imperial
authority, to which India never attained. They gradually became
official religions, as which they survive; such religious
piety as the population of China and Japan experiences finding
its outlet chiefly through Buddhism. Buddhism may be said
to have failed in India because it aimed at being a world religion;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484"></a>[484]</span>
because it tried to be international instead of national,
to overlie all cultures instead of identifying itself with one.
The Hindu like the Jew preferred remaining within the limits
of his nationality and particular civilization.</p>

<h3 id="section259">259. <span class="smcap">Relations Between India and the Outer World</span></h3>

<p>The first culture influence whose entry into India can be
traced in any detail was that carried by the Vedic Aryans from
the northwest. In fact, as already mentioned, more is known
about this importation than of what it encountered in India.
In the post-Vedic period, the introduction of the Semitic
alphabet suggests that other cultural ingredients also flowed
into India from the west without direct record being preserved
of their transmission. The Persian and Macedonian conquests
extended only over the westernmost margin of India and were
of little direct influence. But the latter was followed by a
semi-Hellenization of southwestern Asia, including for instance
the establishment of a Græco-Bactrian kingdom in southern
Turkistan and Afghanistan, adjacent to India; and for several
centuries a stream of Greek culture elements trickled into the
heart of India. Sculpture, architecture, astronomy, drama,
coinage, derived new impetus, in some cases even their origin,
from this source. In some instances the Hindus were no more
than copiers of Hellenistic models: Greek hangs and folds were
given to sculptured garments, Greek astronomical measurements
taken over without change. Yet as the centuries wore on and
new imports along these lines lessened and then died out, the
introduced elements became more deeply incorporated into
Indian civilization, modified and encrusted more and more
heavily by distinctive Hindu styles, until now their superficial
appearance makes an impression of independent native growth.
The working over of the Semitic alphabet into its Hindu forms
may be taken as typical of the nature and degree of this
remodeling of the Hellenistic culture imports.</p>

<p>Soon after 700 A.D. commenced a series of Mohammedan
invasions and conquests—Arab, Afghan, and Mongol-Turkish—also
from the northwest, and of course accompanied by a new
series of culture influences—firearms, for instance, and the true<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485"></a>[485]</span>
arch—which in their turn underwent absorption and partial
transformation.</p>

<p>The flow of culture between India and the Mediterranean
world has not been wholly eastward. Cotton; the common
domestic fowl; probably the buffalo and rice; perhaps asceticism,
monastic life, and certain mystic points of view; position
numerals with zero; chess; and some of the concepts of modern
philology, were transmitted westward. Eastern Africa was
influenced, largely through the medium of Arab sea trade. Towards
the north and northeast as far as Mongolia and Japan,
India has been a dispenser of culture content and has taken
little in return. Toward the southeast, Indian influence has
been the largest component in the civilization of Indo-China
and the East Indian archipelago, which as regards their higher
attainments may be regarded as cultural dependencies or extensions
of India.</p>

<h3 id="section260">260. <span class="smcap">Indo-China</span></h3>

<p>Farther India or Indo-China, the great southeastern peninsula
of Asia, falls somewhat short of India and China in area, is
less densely inhabited, and contains a population which is of
definitely Mongolian type except for some scattered fragments
of hill tribes. On the basis of speech, four groups are to be
distinguished. In the southwestern and southeastern corners of
the peninsula, in the former kingdoms of Pegu and Cambodia,
are the Mon and the Khmer, certainly related to each other and
perhaps distantly connected with the Malayo-Polynesian family.
On the east are the Anamese, with a monosyllabic, tonal language
whose affiliations are doubtful. It contains a Chinese
element, but perhaps by absorption rather than by original connection.
The center and west of Indo-China are occupied respectively
by the peoples of the T’ai or Siamese-Shan and
Tibeto-Burman groups, both probably collateral offshoots with
Chinese from what may be called the original Sinitic stock
(§ <a href="#section50">50</a>). The movement of population has clearly been out of
inner Asia into the peninsula. The Mon-Khmer are situated
like half submerged remnants. Burma on the map hangs from
Tibet like the outgrowth that it probably is. Seven centuries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486"></a>[486]</span>
ago, the T’ai empire was centered in Yünnan, in southwestern
China. Siam represents a southward shift of the seat of T’ai
power after Mongol conquest (<a href="#figure12">Fig. 12</a>).</p>

<p>The Malay peninsula is Siamese in its narrow or neck portion.
The head is inhabited by three racial groups. The
Semang in the interior are pure Negritos. The Sakai or Senoi,
also in the interior, are short in stature, dark, and broad
nosed, but wavy-haired. They resemble a series of hill tribes
scattered from India to the East Indies: the Vedda of Ceylon,
the Irula and other tribes of southern India, the Toala of
Celebes (§ <a href="#section27">27</a>, <a href="#section257">257</a>). Perhaps the Kolarians or Munda-Kol of
central India, the Moi and other groups of Indo-China, the
Nicobar islanders, and certain nationalities of Sumatra are also
to be reckoned as partial representatives of the same type. This
race, if it is such, is generalized, with certain Caucasian and
other Negroid but few Mongoloid resemblances. It is perhaps to
be classed as Australoid, and has been named Indo-Australoid.
The third racial group of the peninsula are the Malays, who, at
least in large part, are emigrants in comparatively recent centuries
from Sumatra. Culturally the Malay peninsula belongs
with the East Indies rather than with Indo-China.</p>

<p>Three main layers of civilization are evident in Indo-China.
The old native culture was allied to that of the East Indies and
the islands beyond—whatever the speech may have been. Even
to-day backward tribes of both regions, especially inland, often
show strikingly similar customs: the use of bark cloth, for instance,
separate houses for unmarried men and girls. This culture
remains fairly well defined in spots as far west as Assam
and the Kolarian region of India.</p>

<p>The two other civilizations have flowed in from India and
China. Practically everything of higher culture in Indo-China
traces back directly to these two countries. The Indian influence
has been both wider and deeper than the Chinese. It
brought in Buddhism and writing, and colored art and architecture.
This Indian influence began more than two thousand
years ago, and while it may have weakened somewhat after
India’s return from Buddhism to Brahmanism, it has never
ceased. As there were no notable Indian conquests, this influence
is an excellent example of the normal, gradual type of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487"></a>[487]</span>
cultural pervading. Chinese contacts are equally old as the
Indian, but have mostly remained confined to the area adjacent
to the Middle Kingdom. The Anamese have adopted the Chinese
system of family names, Confucianism, literary examinations,
and the like, sometimes more largely as a conscious endeavor
than in fact.</p>

<h3 id="section261">261. <span class="smcap">Oceania</span></h3>

<p>From the Malay peninsula the vast island region of Oceania
stretches eastward to within two thousand miles of America.
Australia deserves to be set apart on account of its continental
size, isolation, and ancient biological independence. Oceania
proper falls into five natural divisions. These are Indonesia or
Malaysia<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> or the East Indies, where large islands are scattered
among many small ones; Papua or New Guinea; and three tracts
of relatively small, widely separated islands rising out of the
depths of the Pacific: Melanesia, a broken chain southeastward
from New Guinea; Micronesia, to the northeast; and Polynesia,
far eastward. Two primary facts stand out in regard to the
inhabitants. Papua and Melanesia are peopled with blacks,
the Oceanic Negroids; the other regions have brown inhabitants
of prevailingly Mongoloid affiliations. Linguistically a single
fundamental speech, the Malayo-Polynesian, prevails over all of
Oceania except Papua, whose tongues so far as known fail to
connect with any others or with one another. Large unanswered
problems inhere in these distributions: how the Oceanic Negroids
are related to those of Africa, from whom they are so remote
geographically but whom they resemble so strikingly in type;
how the black Melanesians came to talk dialects of Malayo-Polynesian,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
which otherwise is a speech of brown peoples.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488"></a>[488]</span>
More in detail, there are questions such as where and how the
Polynesians developed their somewhat aberrant racial characteristics;
what may be the relations of a more and a less specifically
Mongoloid, a broader and a longer headed strain, among
the East Indians; and whether the latter of these connects
racially with the “Indo-Australians.”</p>

<h3 id="section262">262. <span class="smcap">The East Indies</span></h3>

<p>Culturally, the East Indies are the most diverse of the
Oceanic regions, in that the various islands, and within the
larger islands adjacent districts, sometimes contain populations
heavily tinctured with Asiatic civilization, sometimes tribes
whose customs are far more aboriginal. However, there is no
people in the East Indies that has wholly escaped the influence
of Asiatic culture: the difference is always one of degree,
although ranging from what is currently called semi-civilization
to savagery. The profoundest influence has been exerted by
India. This began nearly two thousand years ago and remained
active for over a thousand; it introduced architecture, sculpture,
writing, monarchy, religion, iron, cotton, and a host of
other elements of higher culture. The earlier Indian influence
was Buddhist and its seat of power centered in southern
Sumatra; the later was Brahman and reached its zenith in
Java. The number of immigrants was probably small, their
effect enormous. A group of refugees, a younger son of a
royal house with his retinue, a band of adventurers, would
found a colony, sometimes conquering the natives, sometimes
attaching them peacefully to their leadership, and soon a little
kingdom was flourishing, which in time sent out other offshoots
or absorbed its rivals until its name commanded respect and
tribute for long distances across the sea. It was a procedure
which the Mohammedanized Malays later repeated over the East
Indies, and which on the Asiatic continent some centuries
earlier had carried Chinese civilization far to the north and
south of its original limits, and Aryan speech and culture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_489"></a>[489]</span>
throughout India. The kingdoms struggled, throve, decayed,
and succeeded one another; the permanent aspect of the process
was the ever deeper though irregular permeation of life with
new arts and ideas.</p>

<p>The influence of China came later and was less than that of
India. In the thirteenth century the Sumatran Malays were
converted to Mohammedanism and began a career of expansion
which culminated in the complete conquest of Java by 1478,
carried their faith over much of the area, and was checked only
by the advent of the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Dutch. Mohammedanism,
besides its cult and law, introduced some new elements
of culture, such as firearms; but perhaps its most important
effect was that it put an end to the growth of the specifically
Indian type of influence in Malaysia.</p>

<p>Underlying these strains from the historic civilizations of
Asia was a semi-primitive culture, many of whose elements were
shared by the East Indians with the Indo-Chinese and Melanesians,
and which in part can be traced from India to Polynesia.
This Indo-Oceanic culture included agriculture—with rice and
sugar cane in Malaysia and on the mainland; domestic animals
of its own—the buffalo, pig, and fowl—different from those of
north and west Asia; pottery, bark clothing, possibly bronze,
though if so this was intrusive; men’s clubs or sleeping houses;
a non-political organization of society on the basis of kinship
and tribal community; and such practices as head hunting and
skull cult. The employment of bamboo and rattan was a prime
characteristic, and seems to have prevented a vigorous stone age
from having flourished in the East Indies and adjacent regions.
Bamboo is perhaps capable of serving more different cultural
uses than any one other plant. It makes satisfactory houses,
rafts, knives, spears, bows, arrows, blowguns, textiles, cooking
vessels, receptacles, and musical instruments, with a minimum
of labor. It is best worked with metal tools, and has therefore
perhaps experienced its most thorough utilization at the hands
of peoples too backward to secure a large supply of metals for
themselves but able to obtain a limited stock of iron from their
neighbors. Nevertheless even the prehistoric culture of the region
is likely to have made large use of bamboo.</p>

<p>This primitive culture of course varied locally. It was also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490"></a>[490]</span>
not of unitary origin. It certainly contained elements that were
older than others, or that originated in different parts of the
area. Rice and fowls for instance are likely to be more recent
than skull cult and use of bamboo. The culture may even resolve,
when it shall have been analyzed more intensively, into
two or more fairly separable strata. But, taken in block, it
must once have prevailed with fundamental similarity from
eastern India well out into the Pacific, since everywhere within
this tract there are to-day hill and jungle peoples whose culture
conforms at least roughly to the type. It is necessary to remember,
however, that nowhere does this culture survive in
purity. To some degree the influence of the greater Asiatic
civilizations has made itself felt among the most aloof tribes.
They mix a few Hindu religious concepts with their head hunting
rituals, for instance, or know how to forge imported iron,
or even grow American maize. They have everywhere been
exposed in some degree to contact with cultures of subsequent
level. Thus it is characteristic that the Negritos, whose scattered
distribution indicates that they may have been the first
inhabitants of the East Indies, possess a debased or parasitic
Malaysian culture instead of a specific Negrito one.</p>

<h3 id="section263">263. <span class="smcap">Melanesia and Polynesia</span></h3>

<p>As one passes out from the East Indies into New Guinea and
Melanesia, the mass effect of Hindu and Mohammedan civilization
comes to an end, and the primitive culture that has been
outlined is altered. Metals, rice, the buffalo, disappear. The
growing of taro and other tropical plants, the pig and fowl,
the use of bamboo where nature permits, skull cult or cannibalism,
remain. Other features, such as the totemic and matrilinear
moiety organization of society and adolescence rites for
girls, obtrude, and are sometimes elaborately developed. How
far such traits represent secondary local developments or on the
other hand survivals from a Negroid culture phase anterior to
that of primitive Malaysian-Southeast Asiatic culture, is not
clear. Local diversity of custom is unusually great in both
New Guinea and Melanesia.</p>

<p>Micronesia and Polynesia present a different although allied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491"></a>[491]</span>
set of problems. The Polynesians in particular manifest a remarkable
uniformity of speech and, on the whole, of culture,
especially in view of the thousands of miles of ocean through
which their island groups are dispersed. This uniformity suggests
that the language and culture became characterized in a
limited area from which they spread over Polynesia after or
while contact with the remainder of the world was lost. But it
is difficult to settle even tentatively on such an area of original
characterization because certain sides of Polynesian culture are
relatively high and carry suggestions of Asia, whereas other
elements are lacking which would be expectable if higher
Asiatic influences had ever carried to the ancestral Polynesians.
Royal lineage, for example, bears to the Polynesians a powerful
implication of sanctity, of descent from the gods, such as is
unparalleled among any truly primitive people. Religion and
mythology also contain an abstract, spiritual strain that is
almost reminiscent of Buddhism. Yet there seems no single
specific idea or name that can be traced to an Asiatic source;
and the essentially ancient ideas of magic and taboo are strong—the
word taboo itself is Polynesian. There are structures and
sculpture in stone, sometimes monumental, but never more than
barbaric in quality. The absence of metals may mean little,
since they might have been possessed but the art have been lost
in the island habitat, often coralline. Yet pottery, the bow and
arrow, the men’s club house, the clan or moiety type of society,
are also wanting or weakly developed. On the other hand, the
dog, pig, and fowl, cultivated plants like taro, bark cloth, cannibalism,
and human sacrifice are shared with the island regions
to the west.</p>

<p>The various Polynesians possess genealogies and often migration
traditions which on comparison, and after computation of
the number of generations, seem to point to two waves of migration,
both within the Christian era, perhaps about the fifth
and tenth centuries respectively. The traditions fail, however,
to throw clear light on the area of origin, since they attribute
this either to Hawaiki, which may be either Java or a mythical
land, or crisscross back and forth among the island groups
within Polynesia. Something of the mysteriousness which the
discoverers felt continues to attach to the origin and history of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492"></a>[492]</span>
this people, and is deepened by the fact that the affiliations of
their racial type remain ambiguous.</p>

<h3 id="section264">264. <span class="smcap">Australia</span></h3>

<p>The human history of Australia is as detached from that of
the remainder of the world as its biological history. The race
is distinctive: sub-Negroid, it might be called. The languages
relate to no other. The culture is primitive and well characterized.
The isolation of Australia was aided by the fact that
the one approach to it other than by a sea-voyage of some length,
the approach across Torres Straits, was blocked by New
Guinea, the area of most backward culture in Oceania. The
Papuans did not possess enough civilization to hand on much
to the Australians; but they prevented higher elements from
Asia from flowing to them.</p>

<p>The Australians lacked not only all agriculture and domestic
animals, but pottery, the bow, and apparently the harpoon.
These deficiencies would at once stamp their culture as pre-Neolithic
in type, were it not that they grind some stone
implements.</p>

<p>All in all, Australian culture is unusually meager on the
industrial and economic side. Houses, clothing, weapons, boats,
tools, are most scantily developed: often lacking and always
rude. This poverty of Australian material culture cannot be
explained wholly from the prevailing desert character of a large
part of the continent, since the natives of the most favored
regions were not appreciably better off as regards variety of
arts conducive to comfort.</p>

<p>Social organization is much more complicated than the arts.
Most of the Australians are divided into moieties, which frequently
are subdivided into four classes or eight-sub-classes, all
exogamous. A frequent peculiarity is that the child belongs to
a different class from both its parents. So far as the moiety
is concerned, custom varies locally as to whether the child is
born into the mother’s or father’s side of the community. Frequently
there are also hereditary totemic groups. These may be
subdivisions of the moieties or descend independently of them.
A few tribes, chiefly in southeastern Australia, are without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493"></a>[493]</span>
moieties or classes; some are totemless (<a href="#figure29">Fig. 29</a>). The moiety
scheme of course prescribes equally that one must marry into
the opposite moiety and out of one’s own. The extension of this
principle to classes and sub-classes still farther limits the group
among whom marriage is permissible, thereby emphasizing its
prescriptive character. Where the individual belongs to a third
or different class from his parents, his wife must come from
the fourth or remaining one, and his children will belong again
to the first or second, according as moiety descent is patrilinear
or matrilinear. Consequently he has blood relatives in every
class; and conversely all the members of each class stand in a
certain defined kinship to every individual in the community,
according to their respective sex and age. This means not only
that certain relatives are within the absolutely prohibited degrees,
but that others are prescriptive spouses. These are only
a few of the innumerable ramifications and variations of Australian
social organization.</p>

<p>The origin of these social schemes is in dispute. Some ethnologists
interpret them as original inventions of the Australians,
manifestations of their peculiar primitiveness. Others
look upon then as evolved somewhere in the region between
India and Melanesia where analogous institutions are frequently
encountered, and as carried into Australia by diffusion or migrations.
The contiguity of Australia to the Indo-Melanesian area
of totems, moieties, unilateral descent, etc., is not likely to be
wholly a matter of coincidence (§ <a href="#section110">110</a>). Moreover, the strongest
development of this type of organization within Australia is on
the whole in the northern part, the tribes that show least or
none of it being in the south, farthest from the presumptive
entrance via New Guinea. On the other hand, certain features
of the systems are confined to Australia: the classes and sub-classes,
the occasional coexistence but non-relation of totems and
moieties, for instance. These variations must have originated
among the Australians; and this raises the question whether
many other traits may also be indigenous. The most probable
course of events would appear to have been the importation of
the basic pattern of exogamy, followed by its diffusion with
numerous new growths in Australia.</p>

<p>Religious status fits the same interpretation. Ceremonial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494"></a>[494]</span>
practices are often, both abundant and elaborate, but ring the
changes on fundamentally primitive concepts like imitative
magic, bewitching, taboo, adolescence and other crisis rites.
These concepts, as implicit in a series of customary acts, might
all have been imported at a very early time; in fact in the main
very likely go back to Palæolithic culture. On this foundation
the Australians developed their locally varying superstructures
of religion, which often differ conspicuously in specific content,
and into which they poured a notable quantity of imagination
or social creativeness. They evolved nothing of a fundamentally
“higher” type of cult because of their unusual degree of insulation
from all the more important later streams of culture.
There occurred no significant import of either new religious
elements as such, nor of material factors like agriculture which
might have raised the economic status, increased the population,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
forced a political organization, and ultimately led to the growth
of basically new religious patterns among the Australians
themselves.</p>

<p>To return to material culture, it may be noted that the
boomerang groups with Australian rites and social organization
in being a highly specialized form of a fundamentally simple
and presumably early type, namely the throwing stick or flat
club. Crescentic throwing sticks are in use in Asia and
America: they fly faster and straighter than rod shaped or
knobbed ones. The Australians alone added the twist which
gives the boomerang its peculiar flight. They may have been
led to evolve this feature through not having higher types of
weapons such as bows and arrows to engage their interest and
energies. At any rate, the discovery of the quality imparted by
the twist may have been made by accident, such as the warping
of an implement, and random experimenting may have brought
the improvements.</p>

<p>Whether the relatively unimportant implements of ground
stone in Australia represent an invention made there or should
be considered one of the small group of culture elements which
like the moiety system may have been imported subsequently
to the main stock of Australian culture, remains to be ascertained.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495"></a>[495]</span>
This main stock is certainly ancient, and in its content
may be regarded as approximately equivalent to the Palæolithic
culture of Europe and probably connected with it by an early
diffusion; although in the specific forms taken by their corresponding
types the two cultures obviously differ greatly, as
indeed the lapse of time and stretch of distance between them
would render inevitable.</p>

<h3 id="section265">265. <span class="smcap">Tasmania</span></h3>

<p>Tasmania is situated toward Australia as Australia is toward
Asia-Oceania. It constitutes an ultimate periphery. Of what
little culture Australia had received from the remainder of the
hemisphere, Tasmania again received only a part. The prevailing
opinion that the Tasmanians were the most primitive of
recent peoples is therefore probably justified. They lacked
everything that the Australians lacked; and in addition lacked
spear-throwers, boomerangs, shields, and ground stone tools.
They are the one population among whom it seems reasonably
certain that a culture of Palæolithic type was preserved unmixed
until modern times. They had chipped knives, axes, scrapers,
and similar tools; wooden spears and clubs; bark rafts; windbreak
huts; cordage and baskets; paint; ornaments of bone and
other animal parts. Unfortunately the Tasmanians numbered
only a few thousands, died rapidly on contact with civilization,
and became extinct in the nineteenth century before scientific
study of their culture or speech had been made. Their religion
and society therefore perished almost unrecorded. Their racial
type is preserved in skeletal material and photographs. It is
clear that it differed from that of the Australians. Their hair
was woolly. They have consequently sometimes been reckoned
as Oceanic Negroes rather than as an Australian sub-type. It
is likely that they represent the first human strain to enter
Australia, which was later absorbed or exterminated on that
continent by the Australians, surviving only in the protected
island of Tasmania.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496"></a>[496]</span></p>

<h3 id="section266">266. <span class="smcap">Africa</span></h3>

<p>Africa is the second largest of the continents, the most compact
and least indented, and, except for Australia, the most
deficient in great mountain systems and the most arid. The
only considerable forested area lies in its west central portion;
the remainder ranges from parkland through steppe to desert.
The population is the densest of any continent reckoned as
prevailingly uncivilized: a hundred and twenty-five millions or
more, some ten to a dozen souls to the square mile.</p>

<p>As regards its races, it is important to remember that the
northern third or half of Africa is inhabited by native “whites.”
There is much confusion on this point. We tend to say African
when we mean Negro. Until recently the word Moor in north
European countries often meant Negro, although it denotes
Mauretanians, Moroccans, who are Caucasians. It is true that
almost across the breadth of Africa there is a transition zone
in which it is arbitrary to classify the population as definitely
Negro or Caucasian. But over the vaster bulk of the continent,
there is never doubt as to the substantial distinctness of the
racial stocks.</p>

<p>The oldest stone age is well represented. Implements of
Chellean type in particular have been discovered in a number
of areas. Whether these are contemporary with the Chellean
remains of Europe is not wholly certain, since they are generally
surface finds. An Upper Palæolithic phase, the Capsian,
with three sub-periods, is well established for North Africa
(§ <a href="#section215">215</a>). It was approximately coeval with the Aurignacian,
Solutrean, Magdalenian, and probably Azilian of western Europe,
and influenced them. Syria and Spain were largely Capsian
in culture. The Neolithic is less well marked as a distinctive
phase in Africa; and evidences of a separate Bronze Age,
other than in Egypt, have nowhere been discerned. There is a
bronze art with casting in lost molds in Benin. This is of undetermined
origin. It may be ancient; but so far as can be told
to-day, iron came into use in much of Africa as early as bronze,
and is worked by modern tribes who do not know bronze.
Dolmens and other megalithic monuments are abundant in north
Africa, absent south of the Sahara. Some of them are later<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497"></a>[497]</span>
than the similar European megaliths, since iron horse-bits have
been found associated with them. It is evident from this summary
that Europe and Africa have been closely associated in
their prehistoric culture, especially in its remote stages. Two
sets of fossil human remains corroborate the connection: Grimaldi
man of Italy was pre-Negroid in type, Rhodesian man
more or less Neandertaloid.</p>

<p>Iron is smelted, worked, and used throughout Africa except
among the dwarf tribes. Apparatus and technique are usually
simple, but efficient. Smiths often constitute a caste, sometimes
a wandering one. Some tribes rank them highly, others repute
them wizards, nearly all accord them a special social position.
There is no other area so large and culturally so backward as
Africa south of the Mohammedan belt, in which an iron industry
flourishes. The existence of the art therefore raises a
problem. Some have thought that its origin was indigenous,
that perhaps even Egypt derived its knowledge of iron from
Negro peoples. On the whole, however, it is much more probable
that the reverse holds. In the more than three thousand years
since iron was worked in Egypt, the process could readily have
been transmitted through the continent. The long lapse of time,
the distances traversed, the comparative cultural backwardness
of central and south Africa, would allow for, in fact would
almost dictate, both the simplicity and the specializations of
the technique.</p>

<h3 id="section267">267. <span class="smcap">Egyptian Radiations</span></h3>

<p>Ancient Egyptian influences have penetrated Africa more
significantly than has generally been thought. It is only
recently that a beginning has been made in tracing them out in
detail in the Nile Sudan. For so intensive a civilization as that
of Egypt to exist in juxtaposition to the southeastern Hamitic
tribes and the Negroes for five or six thousand years without
radiating innumerable elements of culture into their life would
be unparalleled. In fact the dynastic Egyptians used materials
like ostrich feathers that were imported from far south, and
depicted Negroid physical types. The trade and association
involved must have flowed both ways. The elements most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498"></a>[498]</span>
typical of Egyptian civilization, and its fabric and organization,
need by no means have been imparted along with the
elements that were transmitted. The fact that they were not
seems to be what has delayed wide recognition of Egyptian
influence in Negro Africa. The general character of the culture
of a modern central African tribe and of the ancient Egyptians
being so profoundly different, diffused culture ingredients
would therefore often appear among the Negroes in a different
form, and always in a different setting, thus tending to disguise
their historic connection. The failure of certain Egyptian traits
to seep through Africa is also readily accounted for. A backward
population broken up into small communities without
much stability would have difficulty fitting such an art as
writing into their scheme of life, in fact would find it useless.
It is therefore not surprising that none of the un-Mohammedanized
tribes of the continent write. Similarly, masonry would
be needless, perhaps economically unfeasible, under the prevailing
social conditions of central Africa. On the other hand,
so obviously utilitarian an art as iron working might be quickly
taken up, once it had been brought into a simple technique. In
the same way, an adaptable domestic animal or plant would tend
to be accepted and diffused, while a concomitant scheme of
political organization or elaborated religious system might fail
to make even a beginning of penetration. It is in this way that
several animals of Asiatic origin came to be kept through considerable
parts or almost the whole of Africa; the horse, camel,
sheep, fowl, for instance, of which at least the first two entered
through the gateway of Egypt.</p>

<p>This does not mean that all constituents of African culture
have their origin in Egypt; still less that the colors or patterns
of African cultures can be derived from that country. However
great a bulk of culture may be absorbed by one people from
another, the organization which is given this, the stamp put
upon it, is necessarily more or less distinctive, because the introduced
constituents meet others already established; and especially
because the recipient culture, even if low, already possesses
a form of its own into which it unconsciously attempts
to fit the new content, and into which, unless the influx is sudden
and great, it usually succeeds in fitting the imports for a time.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499"></a>[499]</span>
However, any specific culture trait common to ancient Egypt
and the modern Negroes is suspect of a common origin, which
ordinarily—though not universally—would mean an Egyptian
or more remote origin. Yet the resolution of such a suspicion
is not always easy. Much depends on the extent and continuity
of the geographical distribution of the trait, and on the actuality
and specificity of the resemblance. On these points the necessary
information is often still incomplete.</p>

<p>The general relation of Africa as a whole to Egypt is paralleled
by the relation of western Europe of four thousand years
ago to the Orient. The bronze, cereals, tamed animals, and
many other culture elements of Europe, including religious
traits like the ax cult, can be derived from the Near East. But
the cities, monarchies, temples, inscriptions, astronomy, and art
of the Orient had not penetrated to farther Europe. Moreover,
European Bronze Age culture was not merely Oriental civilization
with half or three-fourths its content omitted. It enjoyed
an organization of its own, followed local and at least partly
original trends, possessed what might metaphorically be called
an organic unity as great as that of any Oriental culture.</p>

<h3 id="section268">268. <span class="smcap">The Influence of Other Cultures</span></h3>

<p>Two other great cultural influences have long affected Africa.
As far back as the strictly historic period extends, its Mediterranean
shore has been generally under the control of peoples
belonging to Western civilization—Carthaginians, Romans, or
Arabs. As in the case of Egypt, it is unthinkable that the cultures
thus planted in the north could have been wholly without
effect on the remoter parts of the continent. In fact, for the
Arabs, who both penetrated the farthest and are the most recent
comers, influence far into the Sudan is manifest. The other
exposure was toward the east, and here, as might be expected,
Indian influences, chiefly sea-borne through Arab restlessness,
have been potent. Eastern Africa has hump-backed cattle,
cotton, the pit-loom, perhaps the fowl, from this source. Madagascar,
though mainly Negro in race, is Malaysian in speech and
prevailingly Malaysian in culture as the result of similar maritime
influences from the east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500"></a>[500]</span></p>

<p>In these lights, much of African culture which cannot yet be
definitely traced to an extra-African source and which until
recently was generally assumed to be of purely native origin,
may prove to be due to transmission from Asia or Europe. The
powerful kingdoms repeatedly established by successful leaders
among both Sudan and Bantu Negroes, kingdoms embracing
diverse tribes and sometimes continuing under the same dynasty
for several centuries, may be due to Egyptian or Mohammedan
example. The same can be said for the prevalence of slavery,
which is both more widespread and more important economically
in Africa than in any other large region of similarly retarded
cultural level. Possibly the frequency of polygyny belongs in
the same category. It is true that Negro economic life is generally
so organized that wives represent investment and create
wealth. This fact might be the result of the influence of old
economic tendencies upon introduced polygyny. Or the form
of marriage might be the outcome of the economic scheme of
life characteristic of Africa. Yet even in the latter case an
indirect foreign causation can be suspected, since primitive peoples,
at any rate those unquestionably beyond the influences of
the Eur-Asian civilizations, like the Australians and Americans,
generally do not place heavy social stress on wealth. The
African point of view as regards economic success, with the
African attitude toward marriage as a consequence, may therefore
be partly due to extra-African stimulus and example.</p>

<p>Such stimulus seems more easily demonstrable for the proverbs
and riddles which abound in Africa, since proverbs were completely
and riddles almost wholly wanting in the western hemisphere,
and are therefore not the native and spontaneous outflow
of the human mind which our own familiarity with them
might tempt us to take for granted (§ <a href="#section90">90</a>).</p>

<p>The totemic and exogamic institutions of Negro Africa (§ <a href="#section110">110</a>)
are difficult to understand. Their distribution, both in totality
and as regards their several forms, is patchy. Clans sometimes
coexist with castes or occupational classes, sometimes tend to
coincide with them. Matrilineal institutions crop up irregularly
among prevailingly patrilineal ones. In several separate areas
the totemic and exogamic groups are divorced, even following
opposite lines of descent. The large blocks of peoples sharing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501"></a>[501]</span>
substantially the same form of organization in Australia, the
regularity of regional and typological graduation of forms of
organization characteristic of North America, find no counterpart
in Africa. The reason would seem to be that the Australian
and American cultures developed in isolation and from within,
undisturbed; whereas Africa has long been subjected to a cultural
bombardment which constantly mingled new traits with
old, foreign with acclimated, and acclimated with indigenous.
The native cultures were therefore unable to follow the relatively
smooth sequence of development by area or stage which occurred
in Australia and America; the injected ferments caused a cultural
bubbling in which elements dissociated, combined, intensified,
or disappeared according to intricate circumstances. It is
possible that other phases of African culture owe their appearance
of randomness under classification to the same set of causes.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<h3 id="section269">269. <span class="smcap">The Bushmen</span></h3>

<p>Two local culture-areas, as they would be called on American
soil, emerge with fair distinctness: The Bushman and the West
African.</p>

<p>The Bushmen of the far south about the Kalahari desert are
distinctive in both race (§ <a href="#section26">26</a>) and speech. Culturally they also
stand apart as an exceptionally primitive people, lacking the
agriculture, cattle and fowls, and iron working of the Negroes.
They are expert hunters, stalking or wearing down game until
it is within range of their poisoned bone or stone pointed arrows,
while the women pry up roots with stone weighted digging
sticks. They live under rock shelters or on the leeward side of
rude windbreaks. Subterranean water is sucked up through
reeds and kept in ostrich egg shells. All this suggests an early
Neolithic or even largely Palæolithic culture type, which accords
well with the remote and environmentally unfavorable habitat.
It is as if the peripherally situated Bushmen had retained up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502"></a>[502]</span>
the present, and with few additions, the culture that prevailed
in Europe ten thousand years ago. It is certainly striking that
they carve and paint animal figures on rock faces and in caves
with a fidelity and unconstrained naturalism that remind of
Magdalenian art.</p>

<p>The Hottentots, who are neighbors of the Bushmen and approach
them in physical type, appearing to be a mixture of
Bushman and other blood, are culturally less retarded, having
cattle and iron. In central Africa another dwarf black race, the
Pygmies or Negrillos, probably represent a people of once primitive
status. But their actual cultural condition is parasitic
rather than natively primitive, thus resembling that of their
relatives the East Indian Negritos. They live among Negro
tribes, acknowledge their kings, trade forest and hunting
products for the agricultural yield and manufactures of the
Negroes, and speak dialects of the latter’s languages. They thus
constitute a racially accentuated caste or economic class within
Bantu culture; and although shy and backward, cannot be said
to preserve a relatively pure early culture as do the Bushmen.</p>

<h3 id="section270">270. <span class="smcap">The West African Culture-area and Its Meaning</span></h3>

<p>Over the larger northern portion of the Congo drainage and
along the Guinea coast from the Niger mouth to the Senegal,
there prevails a well defined West African culture. This is
marked by a number of traits which within Africa are approximately
confined to it. These traits include the cultivation of
the banana but general absence of millet and cattle; gabled
houses of thatch, other Africans building domed or conical
structures or mud dwellings; clothing of palm fiber or bark;
straight self-bows with pointed ends and encircling ridges for
the attachment of the looped cord of rattan; shields of wood or
cane, in place of which other Africans employ leather bucklers,
shields of hide, or parrying sticks; face masks for religious
purposes; carvings of the human form; slit wooden drums;
xylophones; and a number of other traits.</p>

<p>Two interpretations can be suggested for this consistent and
geographically limited association of traits. One makes use of
the recurrence of many of the elements in the Indo-Oceanic and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_503"></a>[503]</span>
especially the Melanesian area. As the latter is also Negroid
territory, an ancient connection is conceivable. This would
obviously have to be old enough to precede the Egyptian, west
Asiatic, and Indian-East African culture developments. These
later growths would be interpreted as having spread less far,
although obliterating the antecedent Negroid culture so far as
they did diffuse. This explanation fits well with the principle
that, other things equal, superposed culture strata appear centrally,
underlying ones survive marginally. Proof, however,
must depend on whether the parallel traits are really specifically
similar, whether they constitute a reasonably large proportion
of the culture of the two areas, and whether they are lacking
in the intervening region. This evidence is naturally difficult
to assemble.</p>

<p>The other interpretation is less incisive. It looks upon the
resemblances as at least partly conditioned by environment; and
would tend to explain the remainder as due to a diffusion, early
indeed, but gradual and applying to single elements or small
clusters of traits rather than to an association of traits large
enough to form a culture and moving as a single block. In this
connection it is significant that the Oceanic area is one of
tropical forest, and the West African area the only large forested
tract in its continent. Hence the absence of cattle and
open-country grains, the use made of the banana. Hence too
the possibility of bark cloth; and the extremely serviceable
rattan cord, which in turn may have demanded a certain type
of bow; whereas other types, like the sinew-backed bow, would
be unsatisfactory in the humid climate. And the carving of
wood, while not due to the forest, was at least made possible by
it. In short, diffusion may have been the motive power involved,
but like environmental conditions in the two areas caught
and helped to preserve such elements as were diffused—stabilized
the culture once it was adapted to the soil and rendered it more
resistive to importations of traits worked out in different climates.
This interpretation at any rate makes smaller assumptions
than its competitor, and serves as an illustration of the
need of environmental conditions being kept in mind in the
explanation of culture, even though the essential explanation
be in social or cultural terms.</p>

<h3 id="section271">271. <span class="smcap">Civilization, Race, and the Future</span></h3>

<p>Culture may be independent of race; possibly is wholly so.
But culture must be carried by races of some sort; and it may
be of interest to consider whether the sweep of culture history
reveals certain races as the most favorable carriers or as inherently
constituted to be producers and dispensers of civilization
(§ <a href="#section44">44-46</a>).</p>

<p>On the whole, the greatest share of culture production has
fallen to Caucasians. The art of Upper Palæolithic Europe,
the laying of the foundations of modern civilization along the
Nile and Euphrates six or seven thousand years ago, the more
special ancient efflorescences like that of Crete, not to mention
most of the advances of the last twenty-five hundred years, all
fall to the account of the white race.</p>

<p>The part of the Mongoloids must not be underestimated.
Even if the foundation of Chinese civilization prove to be
largely western, its main structure is native, and the alien
elements that flowed in during the last three thousand years
have been thoroughly adapted to this structure. The fact that
derivative civilizations like the Japanese have succeeded in
reaching a high degree of organization and refinement argues
still further for the vigor of Chinese culture. Then, the East
Indians, another Mongoloid branch, have shown a fair power
of assimilation. In the past two thousand years they may be
said to have accepted and digested at least as much of Hindu
and Mohammedan civilization as the North Europeans took over
from Mediterranean sources between 1500 B.C. and 500 A.D.
Finally, the achievements of the American Mongoloids in
Mexico and Peru must be given heavy weight because they
appear to have been made in utter isolation, without the stimulus
of contact or import, and on the basis of nothing more than a
late Palæolithic or earliest Neolithic culture.</p>

<p>The share of the Negroids in the higher advances has been
small. Africa, to be sure, lies off to one side from the great
Eur-Asian axis, and like southern India and Arabia has suffered
from constituting almost a blind alley. Yet central Africa
is no farther from the Mediterranean than is northern Europe.
East Africa lies open to Egypt which six and five and four thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505"></a>[505]</span>
years ago represented the apex of civilization. Yet Negro
Africa to-day possesses scarcely more culture elements of
Egypto-Babylonian origin than remote Scandinavia had absorbed
by 500 B.C., and far fewer than Scandinavia had in
1000 A.D. It is hard to believe that this difference is due wholly
to desert and jungle and tropical heat.</p>

<p>There is a parallel in the Oceanic Negroes. The Australians
may be disregarded in this connection, both on account of the
isolation of their continent and the doubt whether they are to
be reckoned as a branch of the Negroid stem. But the Papuans
and Melanesians are undisputedly Negroid and far less touched
by influences of higher culture than the adjacent East Indians.
It may be only geographic accident that writing and iron and
kingship and Hindu and Arab religion traversed the Oceanian
islands as far as the brown Mongoloids inhabited them, but
stopped dead at the threshold of the blacks. Even the brown
Polynesians, much more remote in the central Pacific than the
Melanesians, possess more elements that are presumably traceable
to Asia—such as their cosmogony, genealogies, kingship.</p>

<p>It is of course not fair to argue from cultural accomplishment
to racial faculty unless all times and parts of the world are
considered equally, and not safe to interpret the evidence too
rigorously then. But the consistent failure of the Negro race
to accept the whole or even the main substance of the fairly
near-by Mediterranean civilization, or to work out any notable
sub-centers of cultural productivity, would appear to be one
of the strongest of the arguments that can be advanced for an
inferiority of cultural potentiality on their part.</p>

<p>Yet the weakness of correlation of race faculty and civilization,
except in the most general way, can be driven home to
North Europeans and North Americans as soon as the relative
parts played in culture history by the several Caucasian divisions
are examined. On the ground of long continued lead in
productivity, of having reared the largest portion of the structure
of existing civilization, the Mediterranean branch of the
Caucasian race would have to be awarded the palm over all
others. To it belonged the Egyptians; the Cretans and other
Ægeans; the Semitic strain in the Babylonians; the Phœnicians
and Hebrews; and a large element in the populations of classic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506"></a>[506]</span>
Greece and Italy, as well as the originators of Mohammedanism.
With the Hindus added as probably nearly related, the dark
whites have a clear lead.</p>

<p>The next largest share civilization would owe to the Alpine-Armenoid
broad-headed Caucasian branch. This may have included
the Sumerians, if they were not Mediterranean; comprised
the Hittites; and contributed important strains to the
other peoples of Western Asia and Greece and Italy.</p>

<p>By comparison, the Nordic branch looms insignificant. Up
to a thousand years ago the Nordic peoples had indeed contributed
ferment and unsettling, but scarcely a single new culture
element, certainly not a new element of importance and permanence.
For centuries after that, the center of European
civilization remained in Mediterranean Italy or Alpine France.
It is only after 1500 A.D. that any claim for a shift of this
center to the Nordic populations could be alleged. In fact, most
of the national and cultural supremacy of the Nordic peoples,
so far as it is real, falls within the last two hundred years.
Against this, the Mediterraneans and Alpines have a record of
leading in civilizational creativeness for at least six thousand
years.</p>

<p>It is clear therefore that any fears of the arrest and decay
of human progress if a particular race should lose in fertility
or become absorbed in others, are unfounded. Such alarms may
be attributed to egocentric imagination. They resemble the
regrets of an individual at the loss which the world will suffer
when he dies; what he really fears is his own death. When we
loosen the hold of such narrow and essentially personal emotions,
and allow our minds to range over the whole of the labors and
gradual achievements of humanity, irrespective of millenium
or continent, the result is an imperturbed equanimity as to the
slight and temporary predominance of this or that racial strain
and as to the stability or future of culture. To contribute to
this larger tolerance and balance of mind is one of the functions
of anthropology.</p>

a social unit forming one of several divisions of such a political unit. A
tribe corresponds in savage or barbarous life to the state or nation among
ourselves. The sib is a sort of enlarged family. The blood relationship is
often mainly fictitious, but it is considered actual or treated as such, and
is the basis of the prohibition of marriage within the sib. The origin of
the sib seems to have been the family. The terms sib, clan, and gens are
here used synonymously. Some writers restrict “clan” to sibs with descent
in the female line, “gens” to sibs with male descent. Sib is perhaps the
best general term, clan the one most used.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="label">[21]</a> It seems quite doubtful whether any American people held seven as a
mystic number in pre-Columbian times. The case most frequently cited is
that of the Zuñi. But these people had a Christian mission in their town
for two centuries; they still employ four and six far more frequently than
seven in their rituals; and their unmissionized neighbors the Hopi and
Navaho esteem four or six but not seven. The other Indians stressing
seven lived either on the Atlantic slope, such as the Delaware and Cherokee,
and have therefore long been in contact with the colonists; or in the
Plains—notably the Siouan tribes—and there came into direct and indirect
relations with the French for two hundred years before ethnologists visited
them. Moreover, the number which the Plains tribes most frequently used
in regard to sacred matters was four. The mystic value of seven may
therefore be traceable to European influence wherever it appears in America.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> The contrary has been alleged. To dispose of the allegations seriatim
would involve the minute examination of much evidence. Clan organization
is here used in reference to arbitrary, named, intratribal exogamic groups
to which the individual belongs inalienably by virtue of his birth, his
descent being necessarily reckoned on one side only; and totemic phenomena
being usually though not always associated with the group. A segregation
of society into groups based primarily on blood kinship, co-residence,
town quarters, occupation, social rank, or subordination to a chieftain
is not a clan organization. Nor is the unilateral reckoning of descent
a sufficient criterion. Our modern family names descend patrilineally
without any historical connection between them and a clan organization.
In general, statements as to the existence of clan systems in Middle
America, at least among the advanced nations of Mexico and Peru, rest
either on a loose use of terms; on the assumption that they must have
existed at the time of discovery; or on a forward projection into the historic
period of the belief that they had once existed. This belief is accepted

<p><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> Why the Southwest with its solid towns of a thousand and more
inhabitants, its generally greater advancement, and proximity to Mexico,
should never have progressed to larger political units, is not wholly clear.
The reason may be that the Pueblo was a heavily ritualized culture, whose
emphasis was on the priest, not the governor or councilor. Such government
as the Pueblos had was distinctly theocratic. They were also disinclined
to fight. Southeastern religion was quite simple in comparison, an
important priesthood lacking, and the warlike spirit rather strong.</p>
